"We've had enough of this bollocks" so said national treasure and football hero, John "Motty" Motson in his capacity as the newly anointed chair of campaign group Football UK Commentators (FUKC). Motty came out fighting today as Arsenal FC announced new signings for the forthcoming season.
"I'm sure Arsenal's management is doing this on purpose. Look, it's okay every other year when we have to put up with all sorts of weirdo Johnny Foreigner names during the European championship or World Cup, we can even cope with a few of them in the Premier League but now Arsenal is taking the piss. I'm arranging a ballot among the membership on whether or not to boycott their matches."
It is the announcement of the signings of Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Stephan Lichtsteiner which has aroused Motty's ire. They are joining Arsenal's squad alongside Papastathopoulos' countryman Konstantinos Mavropanos, 20, who joined in January. He was the first signing by new head of recruitment Sven Mislintat, formerly chief scout at Dortmund.
That month Arsenal also brought in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Dortmund and Henrikh Mkhitaryan - another ex-Dortmund player.
"Let me explain" said the normally affable Motty. "Every other year I would spend six weeks from early May to mid-June learning by rote unpronounceable players' names for the European Championship or World Cup. Then there would be three of four weeks of stress putting that into practice and trying not to laugh at some of them. Do you remember Shittu and Dudu? Yes, somehow they both ended up at QPR and their names were quite appropriate. There was also Rafael Scheidt but those players weren't a problem.
"What's happening now is that this malarkey will also be going on throughout the whole of the football season with no let up, particularly when Arsenal is the commentary match. Look, we've just got used to Arsenal's Polish goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, when they ship him off to Italy, only to make it even worse.
"Paul Merson is going insane about this. After all, we've only just managed to get him to speak English and his old club is now about to fry what few brain cells he has.
"As for international tournaments, the Poles and the Balkan teams are usually the worst ones to learn: Jakub Blaszczykowski, Artur Jedrzejczyk and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic are prime examples. Get your tongue around those, if you can. But of course this year we've got the Middle Eastern teams, plus Japan and Nigeria complicating our task even more. Just think of it - for Nigeria we've got Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Kelechi Iheanacho and for Japan, Masaaki Higashiguchi, and those are the easy ones. 
"It's not easy for my members, but for me there is the consolation of having retired, plus I'm not an international cricket commentator. Just imagine Sri Lanka's matches - Sadeera Samarawickrama, Kapila Wijegunawardene, Pramodya Wickramasinghe etc. Now that is commentator's hell..."

The Wimbledon Tennis Championships start on 2 July at SW19, and there are some tasty-looking female competitors taking part once again, for all those viewers who aren't that keen on watching tennis, but don't mind a bit of 'leerage'. So, for your delight and delectation, here is the Spoof guide to the Wimbledon 2018 Wondergirls, and a few 'ropey' munters as well. 
To begin with, let's look at Simona Halep. She's Romanian, and quite tasty. In 2009, she underwent breast reduction surgery on her enormous jugs, to make them less 'wobbly'. She should have been arrested for this.
The number 2 seed is Caroline Wozniacki. She's blonde, and from Denmark. I cannot speak too highly of Caroline, so I won't; I'll speak lowly, even for me - I would!
Number 3 seed, Venezualan Garbiñe Muguruza, is the defending champion. She's a bit 'horsey', if I'm honest, and not really my type. As the saying goes: "horses for courses". I'll pass.
Caroline Garcia is the French number 6 seed. She is very athletic, and probably has an extremely tough, sweaty workout that I wouldn't mind trying in her company. Dark hair, beautiful tanned skin tone, and sultry-looking. I hope she does well, and that she 'thanks' me for my 'support'.
Angelique Kerber is the eleventh seed. German, she's blonde, and has a left-hand grip, if you could just visualize that in your mind for a minute! She has extremely powerful-looking thighs. Well, she did in the photo I ogled.
Elise Mertens is another blondie. She's from Belgium and seeded 15. It's possible that she eats chocolates, whilst laid back in a bath full of bubbles.
Naomi Osaka, the number 18 seed, is Japanese. She's stunning, and, at only 20, it makes you wonder what her mother is thinking of, letting her daughter go globetrotting like this! She's bound to find trouble - the little minx!
Maria Sharapova is seeded 24, but would always be in my Top 3. Still grunts.
Back at 4, we have Sloane Stephens, an American, who looks like she might be fun on a night out. Looks can be deceiving, of course.
There are others who you 'might like to kiss', but let's now turn to the other end of the spectrum.
It's an accepted fact that not everyone has the same opinion where beauty is concerned. For those who like a spot of 'muntering', here are the nominations:
Seeded 5, Elina Svitolina has a rhythmical name, but she looks a bit heavy. 
Ashleigh Barty, an Australian, is in at 17. As well as a tennisess, she is also a cricketress. I don't know her position at cricket, but she looks as if she'd make a damned fine wicketkeeper.
At 7 and 8, are two players with names that might confuse, particularly if you've been drinking. Karolína Plíšková and Petra Kvitova. Yes, 'KP' and 'PK'. Could almost be anagrams. Neither will win a beauty contest.
The tenth seed, US player, Madison Keys, has a real mouthful of teeth. Indeed, her surname is said by some to have derived from the fact that her family going back to the Mayflower have had large teeth, which could easily be mistaken for piano keys.
And finally, try to avoid looking directly at Barbora Strýcová, a Czech national seeded 24, who could conceivably kill you with her stare. 
The Lily Adams of this year's championship.
Enjoy!

BILLINGSGATE POST: The Wall Street Journal reported today that Trump would not answer questions pertaining to a North Korean trademark awarded for the exclusive franchise rights to the new dog burger franchise named "McMuttleys."
After taking considerable heat from left wing media sources concerning using the Trump name and influence for gaining trademark rights in China, this new revelation by the Wall Street Journal only adds gas to the fire regarding the Trump empire and the Presidency.
This coming after the controversy during the White House visit by then South Korea President Park Geun-hye with President Obama three years ago. At that time it was suspected that Bo, the Obama family dog, had been dog napped by the Korean President. However, this was much ado about nothing as Bo, a Portuguese Water Dog, was found in the Lincoln Bedroom with a coterie that included Kim Kardashian, Quasimodo, George Clooney, the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Papal Nuncio, the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Lindsey Lohan and the Mayor of Cairo; plus the supernumeraries who held their robes.
It was also reported in the Journal that McMuttleys, instead of a Golden Arch, will feature a dog lifting his leg on a fire hydrant. The “Big Mutt” sandwich will include two layers of dog meat smothered with kimchee on a sesame roll slathered with a special Russian dressing. But to avoid any inferences of collusion, this dressing will be manufactured in a Top Secret location outside the domain of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.
Trump was out of the country on official government business and was not available for comment on this story. However, Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that the President couldn’t wait to chomp down on a Big Mutt and fries as soon as he lands in Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jung Un.

The White House. 24 minutes ago. Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called reporters to the Briefing Room a short time ago to announce that President Donald J. Trump had issued another celebrity-championed posthumous pardon. Today's recipient was Mary Surratt, executed on July 7, 1865, for her role in the conspiracy to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln.
Sanders informed reporters that the fading former film great B. B. Blackridge, once known for his role as an enforcer in B movies based on comic book characters but of late a long time between films, had personally met with the president in the Oval Office to present the case for pardoning the first woman executed by the federal government. Blackridge laid out the case for pardoning Surratt, noting that witnesses against her were unreliable, that the trial took place in a military court rather than the civil one she was entitled to, and that the execution was carried out within a week of sentencing.
Trump announced the pardon in a tweet. "A truly great boarding-house operator," Trump wrote of Surratt, adding that "many thought her execution was simply a backlash of anger over the death of the president. She would never have been convicted in a federal court with a jury of her peers. And she was given insufficient time to appeal the erroneous sentence of death. Yes, she was a Confederate sympathizer, but so were half the people in the country."
"The government treated her badly," Trump concluded.
Descendants of Mrs. Surratt could not be reached for comment, but the leftist mainstream media immediately conjectured that this was simply a precedent for pardoning his fellow conspirators in the Russian interference in the 2016 election.

'Embarrassment' was hardly the word to use for one man in Battambang this morning, after he tried to stifle a fart that his instinct told him, was likely to have a major impact in his classroom.
Moys Kenwood, 54, attempted to subdue the pump he knew very well would 'end in disaster' if any of his 11-year-old students heard it, but, alas his efforts were in vain.
Halfway through a Science lesson about 'Water and Wind', and whilst the students were silently completing a written exercise in their notebooks, the teacher started to feel uneasy about the 'wind within' which, he feared, might soon be the 'wind without'.
To counter this, he nipped-in his buttock cheeks, and prayed a silent prayer to an imagined God of Ultimate Mercy, but the God wasn't out of bed yet. The fart was on its way - ETA: two seconds.
To lessen the devastation, Kenwood quickly sat down on a green plastic chair that was nearby. In hindsight, this would seem to have been a catastrophic error.
A sound powerful enough to simultaneously yank twenty-five heads up out of notebooks, resounded through the room, followed by a small tremor. Quizzical looks, furrowed brows, and scrunched-up faces of utter disgust were on twenty-five faces, and laughter, bordering on 'hysterical', was about to emerge from twenty-five throats.
In desperation, Kenwood feigned 'innocence', and stood and looked accusingly at the plastic chair, as if it had somehow been responsible for the 'noise', but the students weren't buying it. The raucous laughter went on unabated until the school bell announced it was time for morning break, sparing further blushes. Said Kenwood:
"Another sixty seconds, and I think I'd have gotten away with it. Never mind. By Monday morning, this will all be a distant memory - I hope!"

Inspiration strikes at the most unlikely of places and times. According to administration officials, President Trump was so irate when he learned a special place in hell had been designated for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that he immediately ordered the Trump Organization to begin development of “a very, very special place in hell” to be emblazoned with the Trump name. And so Trump Hades was born. Finally, a place in hell befitting the great man himself.
Of course, the Trump team immediately began reaching out to their Russian contacts in the underworld. Apparently, Joseph Stalin is on board trying to arrange a meeting with the Prince of Darkness himself.
Reportedly, Trump Hades would include a luxury hotel where you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave, a spa replete with saunas and sulfur pits, a lake of fire, and an 18 hole championship golf course Golf Magazine calls the 18 Circles of Hell.
All of this is contingent on securing financing which could come in the form of a partnership with Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner who is said to be negotiating a sale of his 666 Fifth Ave. property in New York.

Mar-A-Lago, FL Eric Trump's sitter lost track of him for a few minutes and found him passed out on the floor after sticking a fork in the electrical outlet. When he woke up, his speaking was odder than usual. Trump was ordered by Melania to call a doctor. So Trump called Ben Carson.
Trump spoke: "Hello, Ben? I'm sorry to bother you but I need you to come down here and bring your doctor bag. Eric was shocked and his behaviour is very strange."
"How can you tell? He's always acted strange around me." said Dr. Carson. 
"He's starting to act a lot like you" admitted Trump.
"I don't understand," said Carson.
"Exactly," said Trump.

SSSHH! Do not mention it within the walls of the Nutters Beach Club, otherwise you will be ejected, non-violently, by our black and white, Eunuch doormen, Ying and Yang! Our club has been declared a non-footy zone and anybody mentioning IT will join a line of 'gang-bangers' hoping to bang Volga Olga!
We have opened the doors for other Nutters including royal hat-maker, Philip Treacy, because his hats worn by royalty in public (how dare they!) are totally, fucking Nuts, and Mr Treacy has now a VIP table alongside Mon Dieu's (Messr Cantona for our American non-footy fans) reserved, life-long table!
Now if anybody in their right mind would pay £80000 for a load of crap perched on Princess Beatrice's bonce, they must be totally bonking nuts (It would look good on BOJO though!).
So, on a holy Sunday at the Nutters Beach Club, no footy songs, jibes, Neymar videos, flags, cheerleaders (only Volga Olga in a Johnny Rotten, ripped T-shirt bearing her shriveled nipples, not to be seen on Facebook, with the infamous logo, "God shave the Queen!") or anything to do with Ras-Putin's global show of mock solidarity without a 'Trump Card' in sight!
Adios, Прощай, aufwiedersehen (were they participating?), tot ziens (they wasn't there either!), arrivederci (them too) and Goodbye (well they certainly were, are, and will be there when the Fat Lady Sings!) 
We are MAD HATTERS here, but nothing compared to Princess Beatrice's 'atrocity exhibition!'

We've all had one - an unwanted call from a call center in India - and usually at the most inconvenient time possible, about something about which we have no conceivable interest. So, what do you do?
Often whilst you are making - or worse, are in the middle of eating - their tea, many people feel they are being rude by merely replacing their receiver, or by just ending the call, and feel obliged to say something, no matter how inane.
"Oh, I don't think so, thank you."
or
"Well, I'm a bit busy just now. Could you call back later?"
or
"I'll just go and get him for you. Hold on, please."
All of these replies are very polite, but when someone you don't know, is ringing you at a time they know will inconvenience you, about something you don't want to talk about, politeness is not necessary.
Instead, here are a few ways of ending the imposing calls. As soon as you see 'INTERNATIONAL CALL' on your screen, and hear an Indian voice ask if he or she can speak to you or a member of your family, you should:
1) BLOW A RASPBERRY Long and hard. The caller won't be expecting this, and almost certainly won't have been trained in how to deal with it.
2) WHISTLE PIERCINGLY As you would if you were hailing your friend who you can just see, off in the distance. The caller will either think there is something wrong with the line, or that you are whistling piercingly to hail your friend who you can just see, off in the distance. Win-win.
3) ANSWER, AND SAY "HOLD ON A MINUTE" Then, without giving so much as a second thought to the situation, go back to whatever you were doing when the phone rang. This is rather satisfying, as you are performing a kind of public service: whilst the caller is awaiting your return, he or she is unable to bother anyone else with their bullshit.
4) ANSWER, AND SAY "BONJOUR!" Tame but effective. How many Indian French-speakers do you think there are? If, by some miracle, the caller says "Bonjour!", you then say "Au revoir!"
5) REPEAT, VERBATIM, WHATEVER THE CALLER SAYS Using their own accent, if at all possible. This will be extremely confusing for the caller, and hopefully, disorienting. Do not worry about the quality of your impersonation; there are no prizes up for grabs.
These are just a few ways to deal with unwanted calls, but there will be many more that may occur to you. Give them all a try! You'll have plenty of opportunity. One thing to remember though, is that you should always be prepared. Plan for a call before you pick up - it can make all the difference to ending your call in a satisfying way!

Child prodigy US tennis player, Jasper Quarante from Ohio, who was recently described as having "the world at his feet", has decided that the game is not for him, and has given up tennis to focus on his studies.
Jasper, who is still only 14, has been playing tennis since he could first hold a racket at age 2, but feels his time would be better spent on his school work if he wants to get good grades and go to college.
His parents, however, aren't happy.
Bill and Janice, both 40, say Jasper was born to play tennis, that's why they gave him such a daft name, so he would stand out from the crowd. Bill:
"He was born for it! When we saw the ultrasound scan of Janice's womb, it looked as if he was preparing to serve - from that moment on, he was, in our eyes, a tennis player."
The couple began buying tennis equipment - rackets, balls, training shoes, sweatbands, clothing - and storing it in the tot's room, which they had painted dark green, and fitted with a grass-green carpet. 
"We wanted him to get used to the environment," said Bill, "so that he would feel 'at home' when he stepped out on the Centre Court at Wimbledon."
They stockpiled videos of 1970s legends John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg, and Ilie Nastase, and bought dozens of tennis instruction manuals. They took him along to his local tennis club when he was three years old, and, by the time he was four, he was showing promise.
He won his first match when he was nine, and made rapid strides. Last year, he was amongst the top 100 players in his zipcode, and stardom beckoned for Jasper, but then...
"He was miserable," says Janice, "all his friends were doing homework, playing football, chasing after girls, stealing cars or sniffing glue, and I guess he just felt like he was losing out."
Nothing had prepared them for this latest shock, however.
"He just came home on Thursday and said he was through with tennis," moaned Bill, "and that he was going to give more time to his schoolwork. I asked him about the riches he was almost certainly throwing away by not becoming an international multi-Grand Slam winner and Davis Cup player, but he just smiled back at me, and said that there was more to life than money, success and fame. Schmuck!"
Janice, too, was disappointed.
"Kids, these days!" she said. "I don't know where they get their ideas from!"

"Frankly, we don't give a toss" was the reaction of France's Champagne industry to the Wetherspoon announcement that the fusty old gits chain of pubs would cease selling Champagne and Prosecco.
Shortly after his recent shock announcement that he was laying off all of his EU workers, JD Wetherspoon’s weirdo chairman Tim Martin, the last living proponent of the mullet, hairstyle of the gods, announced that his licensed premises would no longer sell the EU's favourite sparkling wines.
The pub chain aims to replace the popular Italian fizz with UK or "new world" alternatives in the next year or two and Champagne will no longer be available at Wetherspoon's pubs from next month.
"There will be an inevitable transfer of trade post-Brexit to countries outside the EU," he said "and this should keep the smart arse London intelligentsia out of my pubs, not that they come in anyway." 
Wetherspoon, which has 880 pubs, will replace Champagne with sparkling wines from the UK, such as "Wide Open and Legless Bubbly" from Virgin vineyards in Basildon and Harley's "Sparkling Piss" Chardonnay from Australia.
Mademoiselle Francoise Peretti, director of the Champagne Bureau said "It seems to be economically driven, combined with Mr Martin's strong expressed feeling about European products and nobody goes into Wetherspoon's to buy Champagne anyway, so who cares?."

The sheets of silk were nowhere near as smooth as #4's thighs. I woke with them wrapped around my head. As I lay there admiring the scenery I noticed a tatoo I'd never noticed before, "#007".
I reluctantly I gently extricated myself for a call of nature. When I returned she was sitting up, "We'll be there soon." she said brushing her hair aside to show one of her green eyes.
"Where is there exactly?" I asked slowly scanning the floor for my clothes.
"Calais," she said softly, but we still have a little time she said taking my right hand and pulling me back to the bed.
"Why is the #007 on your thigh?" I asked as she wrapped her legs around me, "I don't remember that...""Mark has us all tatooed like cattle, he considers us....property, " she said calmly as if it were nothing to her.
"But, you are known to him as #4?" I said confused."Actually he thinks I'm #7, but that's his mistake as I'm not a clone at all, I'm the original, the only one with a birthmark," she said coyly, "I let him think it because...he has a soft spot for her, helps me get away with....murder sometimes."
"Oh," I said kissing her lips, "And so where is the birthmark exactly?""That...." she said pulling the sheets over the top of our heads, "is for me to know and you to find."
No man should argue with that logic. Certainly not me. An hour later the hydrofoil settle gently into a private marina near Calais, France. She lead me off of the craft and to a waiting Fiat in a parking area.
"Were going into the Chunnel, but not all the way...we'll get off the train part way," she said."Isn't that a bit fast to jump from at 200 mph?" I asked."Don't worry luv, I know how to make the train stop," she winked."That's what worries me," I replied, "What exactly is your plan when we find our dear Editor?"
"Well," she said, "A little reunion I guess, but then I thought we'd kill him.""Oh," I said surprised at how low my objection was to this idea, "And supposing he isn't...cooperative." The Fiat's brakes squeeled and the car jerked to a halt.
"Look I came to get you to help me, not be the ruddy Spanish inquisition, I've had it with this life, I'm through working for this bastard, he HAS TO GO! So make up your mind, you're either with me or against me there is no in between this time. Oh and no time in the laundry chute with me til the job is done!""Wow you are serious, well okay then," I attempted a laugh.
We boarded the train with tickets she was carrying and sat somewhere near the middle. Seven took out her phone and opened an app I'd never seen before, but it looked like simulator for the train, with controls. We went from 0 to 298 in about 2 minutes. Seven put her finger on the slide control for the accelerator and gently brought the train to a stop. She put the phone in a pocket of her jeans and amid the ensuing malais we quietly slipped out the door we came in and into the Chunnel. 
It was remarkably well lit and big and Seven seemed to know exactly where she was going as we entered a maintenance door with a magnetic key card she seemingly pulled from nowhere. Inside the door it appeared to be nothing but a mop closet, only about 4 x 6 ft. Seven leaned down and pulled back a rubber mat revealing...a laundry chute.
"It's left over from The Spoof building," she said as she jumped in and disappeared. What memories this was bringing back, I dove in head first.

United South Western Delta Phi airlines today announced new employment opportunities. The airline is looking to solve several recent problems it has had with pets dying; humans needing mid-air medical assistance or operations; violent passengers and seats that appear too small to sit in. 
USWDPA Spokesperson Darla Keenan said, "We believe we can solve all or our problems by just reacting to them rather than solving them. So instead of figuring out ways to provide better customer service we intend to keep you in the air and operate on you, your dog, your cat. If you piss us off at least one of our stewardesses will be a former boxer. If you can't fit into your seat our contortionist will teach you how sit in it."
USWDPA is hoping the implement the new strategy just as soon as it can complete hiring and training for its new employees.

In what appears to be a misguided attempt to get a break from their teenage sons, a Nevada couple purposefully attempted to cross the U.S./Mexico border illegally. 
According to reports, Stan and Fran Druzinski of Winnemucca, Nevada were caught attempting to swim across the Rio Grande near El Paso. The couple allegedly approached a border patrol officer saying, "no habla ingles" and "yo no se." It was later discoverd that "I don't speak english" and "I don't know" were the only two phrases Mr. Druzinski could remember from three years of spanish class in high school. The border patrol officer reported something odd about their encounter as the two sons were quoted as saying, "what the hell are you doing mom?" while the parents tried to cover their mouths. Despite his suspicions, the officer followed protocol, separating the family and sending them to different detention centers. 
Throughout the next several weeks the boys were very disruptive during their stay at Casa Padre, with several workers describing them as the "worst behaved kids we've ever had here." 
"They kept calling the other kids "dill weeds" and complaining about the food and lack of Play Station 4s" one employee at the facility stated.
It wasn't until their deportation hearing that the parents fessed up. Mrs. Druzinski described her detention as the "most relaxing three weeks of my life" and Mr. Druzinski stated that he hadn't "had that much fun since college."
The decision to get themselves arrested seemed to stem from a recent altercation with their children that neighbors described as "typically nasty" where both boys hung their parent's underwear out on a tree in front of the house. There is a long documented history of incidents where the children were obstinate and disrespectful to their parents. 
When pressed during the hearing, Stan explained, "we just really needed a break from them. We love our boys, but they're total bastards." 
"we really had hoped for a little more appreciation for all of the hard work we've put into raising them at this point," Fran stated, eliciting laughter from the other people in attendance. 
Although authorities strongly suggest against taking such extreme measures to get a little break from your brat kids the Druzinskis stayed very positive despite being charged a heavy fine of $20,000.
"Best money I ever spent," Stan Druzinski said.
"If I was given a second chance I'd do it all over again," Fran agreed.

Have you ever had a nosebleed that, no matter what arresting action you took, the darned thing just would not seem to stop bleeding?
Well, that was exactly the situation being faced by one Los Angeles woman called Janet Farmer this week after she 'sneezed' while out walking her dog, Taylor, who enjoys a scamper on the grass.
Initially, Janet thought it was just one of those 'regular little nosebleeds' that come along, and are easily stopped by that dirty, old piece of tissue that she, like everyone else, keeps in the pocket of her jacket, but, when that turned red, she tried using the back of her hand.
This was not a good plan, though, and soon her hand looked like it had been injured in it's own right, rather than her nose, and she looked around for something to wipe it with.
By this time, Taylor was starting to look tired, so she returned to her car, popped the doggy into the back seat, and got the cloth she sometimes cleaned her muddy boots with out of the trunk. Still the blood did not stop.
Janet drove home, nervous now, but not yet panicking. She knew she wasn't far from home, and, once there, could use cold running water to stem the flow - no longer a trickle - from her nose. In the meantime, she drove one-handed, pressing the muddy cloth to her face with the other hand.
Once in her kitchen, she applied cold water to her bleeding nose, but all that happened was that the blood now streaming from it into her plastic washing-up bowl gave her the appearance of someone who had endured a dangerous three minutes with Mike Tyson. Or Joe Louis. You get the picture.
She rang her best friend, Maddie, leaving a trail of blood on the kitchen floor and into the living room, ruining her new cream carpet. "Put your head back," said Maddie, so Janet did. Maddie went back to her yoga.
Janet was now in terror. She felt giddy as the blood which should have been coming out of her nose, now started to make its way into her oesophagus, and towards her brain. She decided to ring an ambulance.
The operator seemed amazed that Janet had been stupid enough to have bothered her with something so trivial, but, begrudgingly, she told her help would be along 'soon'. She hadn't liked the gurgling sound the caller had been making.
Forty minutes later, as Janet lay helpless on her cream and red carpet, with Taylor doing a frantic dance, the doorbell rang. Taylor went to answer it. Fortunately, in her mad rush to get to her sink, Janet had left the front door unlocked, and the ambulance crew were able to gain entry. One of them, Gus Hewitt, said:
"It looked like a crime scene. I thought she'd been shot. When we realised what was up, we put her in the meat truck and got her to ER as quick as we could. She'd lost a lot of blood."
Doctors managed to stop the bleeding, and later sent Janet home, saying she should either stop picking her nose on her dogwalks, or else cut her nails.

Breaking: Mr. Trump’s advisors are suggesting Mr. Rudy Giuliani may substitute for Mr. Trump at the upcoming June 12 meeting in Singapore.
Why is not entirely clear, ranging from a cheeseburger that went down the wrong way, to a rumor Melania will return to Slovenia with son Baron to improve his education.
Mr. Trump has needed “to move off center field” for a moment, according to a spokesperson.
Mr. Giuliani indicates immediate commitment to serve the international demands of this important summit.
He was to receive “Mouth of the Year” award from The New York Times on that same date, but “duty to a higher cause decides me.”
As to preparation, Mr. Giuliani has replied, “Mr. Kim will be on his hands and knees that first evening we meet, believe me.”
Asked whether this statement represents Mr. Giuliani’s negotiating style, he replied in the affirmative.
He further explained that “negotiating” with the United States actually means coming to terms with a list of demands first, “before there is one penny of sanctions relief.”
To the demands:
*a six months time table by which all nuclear weapons (and any other destructive devices) are delivered to the US without fail or delay.
*shutting up about further increased exercises around the northern Korean peninsula, including B-52 flights directly over Pyongyang.
*absolutely and with no equivocation no return to nuclear armaments, plus dismantling of the North Korean Armed Forces.
*Mr. Kim to retire to an abandoned monastery in remote mountainous terrain of North Korea 
*regime change further accomplished within a THREE months time table by importing war hawks from South Korea to take over the governing of North Korea.
“Any resistance to these ideas and I walk,” Mr. Giuliani said, with no sign of humor.
Asked whether Mr. Trump agrees with this approach (containing contributions from National Security Advisor John Bolton), Mr. Giuliani replied:
"It's basic playbook. How can he disagree?"
Meanwhile, Mr. Kim of North Korea has responded.
“It will be a merry day in North Korea when I am on my hands and knees in Singapore, and Mr. Giuliani is flat on his back with my fat right knee across his chest.”
He added: “We could also arm wrestle, if he would like that.”
Mr. Trump has been difficult to locate for his take on this matter, but has at last been found in a dark corner of a McDonald’s near the White House. 
“Yes, well I must say this repeated hostility from Mr. Kim is surprising, and as before we may need to call off this conference.”

North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un was reportedly seen standing under the German Prime Minister's bedroom window this morning playing a ukulele and singing the popular hit "Xs and Os."
The fat tyrant is reported feeling very randy after swallowing a jelly donut laced with 50x the standard dose of ecstasy.
The side effects of the drug also explain the despot's recent touchy feely moment with the South Korean president, and his willingness to give up all his nuclear weapons, just for the chance to meet his idol, President Baby Snatcher.
The giant pig then killed a few of his closest relatives, who he suspected were giving him the stink eye.

After ridding the world of Banana Republic, terrible, fake actors, our superstar, 85 year-old, nymphomaniac, resident dancer, Volga Olga, born on the banks of the Black Sea, in Ras-Putin's annexed world of opulence, and Czar palaces, swapped her brown bananas, Josephine Baker style, for Brazil Nut-ters!
Rio's infamous carnaval has invited Volga Olga over to head the 2019 carnaval in her Brazil Nut-ters dress after, Neymar, crying his eyes out on liters of Belgian beer in The Nutters Beach Club last night, jumped on stage and rolled over in pain and agony attempting to avoid Volga's swinging nuts!
What a spectacle! Even our resident pissed pirate, poet laureate, Sir Francis (no not the duck version) Charlton, fell off his bar stool with Erskine, his blind, deaf and dumb parrot in pain through laughter!
English non-violent hooligans went mad as they moshed in front of the stage hoping to crack Volga's Brazil nuts and kick the crap out of Neymar, real men, rugby style!
Luckily, he escaped through the bog window and is now on his way to Madrid to lick Ronaldo's boots!
Hasta la vista hombres, putas, et global Nutters! We love you all!!

Singapore In their summit meeting, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un and U.S., President Donald Trump regarding Trump's Twitter use.
"Kim bet me that I couldn't stay off Twitter for 2 months. If I do, he gives up his nukes. If not, the U.S. has to build a Disneyland in Pyongyang" confessed Donald Trump.
"I hope the American people can appreciate what I'm sacrificing here" said Trump on MySpace, since he can't use Twitter. 
It was well-known that Trump would do anything to make any kind of deal with Kim, just so he wouldn't have to admit defeat once he flew home.

Dutch Formula One racing driver Max Verstappen, who has been the recent target of much intense criticism over his driving style, has reacted angrily by planting a headbutt on his mum.
Verstappen, 20, was preparing for the Canadian Grand Prix at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve last week, and was asked why he had been involved in so many accidents this season. He rounded on reporters, and told them:
"I'm tired of all the questions. If I get a few more, I will headbutt someone."
The unfortunate recipient turned out to be none other than his dear old Mutti, Sophie Kumpen.
Returning to his Montreal hotel where his mum, having flown over from Europe to lend Max her support, was waiting for him to have dinner, the two met and embraced, but mum could sense Max was agitated. She asked him what was wrong, but he just shook his head. They went into the restaurant to eat, but Max couldn't seem to make his mind up about the menu. His mum ordered for him: a hotdog with fries, and a can of cola.
When the food arrived, Max was fidgety, didn't eat, and again his mum asked what was the matter and why he hadn't touched his din-din. Suddenly, Verstappen rose from his seat, leaned back, and then thrust his head forward at speed, connecting squarely with the bridge of his mum's nose. Dinner was over. Kumpen recovered her poise, and left alone. Verstappen finished his cola, then also left. A tip was not left.
A spokesman for Red Bull said:
"He's a bit moody at the moment, but you know what these kids are like!"

38-year-old Wisconsin man, Louis Shortpecker, recently told news reporters that he feels like a complete loser.  "I'm not really sure why, but sometimes I get the subtle feeling that I'm a complete loser. Maybe I feel this way because I haven't achieved all of my personal and professional goals, or perhaps it's because I've never had a successful relationship. Sometimes I wonder if I feel like a failure simply because my schooling never really got me anywhere. The feeling may even be a result of the fact that I have trouble staying on top of things during the week." 
When further questioned, Louis stated: 
"It could be possible that I'm just being too hard on myself, or it may be due to the fact that my mom came up to me earlier today and said,  You really are a big disappointment!' Immediately after that, my next-door neighbor came over and said, 'Louis! I've known you for years, and I just wanted to tell you that you are a total fuck-up and a douche-bag!' A few minutes ago, an old classmate of mine also sent me a text message telling me that I am a hopeless piece of shit. Maybe those are the reasons why."
After the interview, Louis went home feeling extremely downtrodden only to further discover that there were no messages on his dating profile and that nobody had "liked" his last Facebook Post. 
Much to his own chagrin, he also found out that his therapist had committed suicide, and that his dog had run away in order to find a new owner.

Roseanne Barr was called "Lady Hitler" by Michelle Wolf on Wolf's new Netflix show, "The Break". Much of this criticism has to do with Barr's online behavior and the so-called “double standard” concerning the horrid comment she made electronically concerning Valerie Jarrett and African-Americans as a whole.
 “Everyone’s been saying it’s so brave of ABC to cancel their hit show, but the bold move was actually putting this lady Hitler chef back on the air in the first place. So kudos to ABC, it takes a lot of courage to fire someone after they’ve been openly racist for the thousandth time,” Michelle Wolf said of the good-for-nothing Barr, who should have been a hanger-on at an inner-city convenience store in Honolulu, making bizarre threats and diatribes to the clerks, rather than making a gawdzillion dollars as her role as big, bad, vociferous volcano-mouthed mama. The series was even named after the racist renegade. For how many years - oh it seems like eons or epochs - the American public has been bombarded by that amorphous mass of madness and mayhem with that show titled, "Roseanne".
Like her hero, Donald Trump, Roseanne Barr has a strong penchant - maybe even an addiction - to tweeting. Yes, she herself is a singing, ringing tweety bird. And the tweet that caused “Roseanne’s” cancellation was one of many conspiracy-fueled posts from Barr during the overnight period of May 29.
And like her alter-ego, the Great Leader of the Orange Race, Barr can't stop at one tweet. She has to rifle off a whole fusillade of the stupid, silly, stupendous 148-character blasphemies to fellow members of the human race. The most offensive of these that night was when she wrote that if the “Muslim brotherhood &amp; planet of the apes had a baby, it would be former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett." (Valerie Jarrett is an African-American woman and Barr is inferring here, in a wider scope, that all Black folks are apes or monkeys.)“Roseanne’s Twitter statement was abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values,” said Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment, in a statement. Then Dungey announced that the network was ending the highly rated reproduction of Barr’s 1990s series. It didn't take long for ABC to come to their decision to shit-can "Roseanne", either. The cancellation was announced the same day of Roseanne's all-night tweeting splurge on May 29.
It's a shame the series was cancelled, but really, it had to be. The reason I write that it's a shame it got shit-canned was because even though this satire and comedy writer finds Barr to be an overrated hack as far as being a comedian and actor is concerned, the show's other actors are finding themselves in a limbo that they don' t deserve. Because of Barr's selfishness, stupidity, and slimy sarcasm, these actors are left to face unemployment. Though none of them, I don't think, will end up sleeping on a Salvation Army cot or eating at a soup kitchen, they are still left jobless in a Hollywood that can be brutal and forgetful of the stars of yesterday.
I have the utmost respect and admiration for John Goodman, who was Barr's husband on the series. In his many appearances on Saturday Night Live, Goodman never failed to deliver the ultimate punch lines when he did his stand-up routines at the opening of these shows. And as an actor in sundry movies, Goodman proved himself as the ultimate character actor in the comedic roles that he filled with such grace and ease. He did a great job playing a bullying and dangerous con-man bible salesman in Oh Brother Where Art Though, for example. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWP07YgUWig" rel="nofollow" target="_self">Even in this Talking Heads' video</a>, he is downright funny and intriguing.
Yes, although Barr had to take up space and add weight to "Roseanne", Goodman was the guiding force and backbone behind the show's success. But in the remake of the series, Goodman seemed too warm and fuzzy and lacked the grit and the grime of the character in the earlier series, who was more akin to a modern-day Fred Flintstone than the hen-pecked, kid-loving wimp that appeared on the brief, stodgy, stupid remake of the lame. decades-later, nostalgia-driven re-take.
On "The Break", Michelle Wolf hit Roseanne Barr with a double whammy, and pointed out a swill of never-ending hell for the minority group that Barr blasted in her tweet, too, offering the argument: "How about we enslave all white people for a couple hundred years and even after they’re not slaves anymore, still hold them down in society, devalue their existence by comparing them to animals, never apologize, never really make it right, and then after that there will be no more double standards and everyone will get fired for everything they say!”
Sure, some intellectually deprived, fellow racists of Barr might have seen this megallon mama as cute, clever, and funny, but in all actuality, racism should never be the impetus or the staring point of building a punch line or a one-liner around. For all too long now, Roseanne Barr has made a fortune by kicking the can around. It's good to see Barr's big, fat can being kicked off the air, though, and God Save the Queen, along with Michelle Wolf. It's good to know that there are still a few sane, rationale, caring people in high places in this crazy country, which is currently owned and operated, it seems, by fucking losers and lunatics!

WARNING: This article was written by a rage-filled and heavily intoxicated author who feels a constant need to express disgusting and needless humor for the sole purpose of fulfilling his own vile ego. It lacks any sort of idealistic cause, and it basically says nothing that should be thought about deeply or even remembered. Thematic patterns do not exist within the structure of its content, grammatical errors were made, and wisdom was not expressed. It is also profoundly loaded with random bullshit. If you are looking for meaning and purpose in your life, then please skip this article and read the next one that gets published. READER DISCRETION IS HEAVILY ADVISED. 
I'm not really sure why, but sometimes I get the subtle feeling that I'm a complete loser. Maybe I feel this way because I haven't achieved all of my personal and professional goals, or perhaps it's because I've never had a successful relationship. Sometimes I wonder if I feel like a failure simply because my schooling never got me anywhere. The feeling may even be a result of the fact that I have trouble staying on top of things during the week.
It could be possible that I'm just being too hard on myself, or it may be due to the fact that one of my family members came up to me today and said, “Hey Wesley, guess what? You really are a Complete Fucking Loser!”
Immediately after that, a personal friend of mine called me on the phone and said, “Hey! I've known you for years, and I just wanted to tell you that you are a total Fuck-Up and a Douche-Bag!” An old classmate also just sent me a text message telling me that I am a hopeless piece of shit.
Maybe those are the reasons why.
Anyway, failure is never an easy thing to deal with, so I've taken it upon myself to provide a list of healthy strategies that will help alleviate the pain and depression that often accompany the feeling that you've completely screwed up in life.
#1) EXERCISE MORE OFTEN
Have you ever gone to the gym, gotten on one of the elliptical machines, and then started exercising vigorously only to have the head of your penis slip out of your boxer briefs right before the rest of your dick (as well as your balls) fall out and start flopping around wildly inside of your cheap, exercise shorts? It's not that this has ever happened to me or anything, I'm just saying that it would be extremely embarrassing if it did happen to somebody.
If it does happen, however, then you need to go back home and re-plan your evening. You could play a video game, or you could just sit back comfortably, open the window, and let a cool breeze flow through your room to air out your sweaty gym shorts as you watch por… I mean the news.
#2) START DRINKING MORE HEAVILY
When a person sinks as far into the abyss of failure as you have, there really is no coming back. Second chances at life and opportunities for positive change actually stop coming around at a certain point. There's probably no way that you will achieve success at anything or become a happy person, so you can always turn to alcohol. Who knows? You may even meet somebody at the bar who feels the same way about life that you do.
As the evening progresses, you might even end up kissing this person after he or she drinks too much tequila and then proceeds to throw up inside of your mouth. I don't know about you, but that sort of thing really turns me on. (There is nothing better than sweetly and passionately pressing your lips against another person's lips right before you feel this incredible and massive flow of vile, chunky, liquid gushing towards your throat. If you're talented enough, you can even swallow some of it and then puke it back into the other person's mouth.)
Instead of spending a lonely evening at home all by yourself while thinking about how much of a shitty loser you are, you can actually have a fun, exciting, and intellectually-stimulating night that is full of puking and really bad love-making.
There is also a big chance that protection will not be used. This means you will have the opportunity to raise some ugly, noisy, rotten, hyperactive, obnoxious, sugar-filled, disgusting, stupid children together right before you both file for a divorce in your mid-40s.
We will all be truly blessed as these creatures you have accidentally created grow up with a misguided sense of self-entitlement after you have pampered them constantly, treated them like they are the best thing in the world, given them everything they wanted, sheltered them from reality, and demanded that their poor, over-worked teachers cater to their every single need. And when they get older, rebel against you, start taking drugs, refuse to work for a living, abuse the unemployment system, and accidentally have children of their own because they have no discipline and they can't think about anything else but sex, you'll probably blame the rest of the world instead of the fact that you were both anal, self-absorbed, over-protective, idiotic parents whose children could clearly do nothing wrong.
Actually, if you get all of that accomplished, you won't be a complete loser anymore. You'll be an uppity, self-righteous, divorced, puke-inducing, worthless bag of shit just like most parents are in your surrounding community.
#3) SAY RANDOM THINGS TO PEOPLE THAT WILL LEAVE THEM FEELING CONFUSED
My advice is to walk up to a complete stranger and say the following:
“Hi! I just wanted to let you know that I'm experiencing cognitive deficiencies, a few self-efficacy problems, a bit of transcendental confusion, a hint of confusing transcendentalism, a small dose of existential pressure, an unbalanced amount of pressurized existentialism, (a troublesome remembrance of highly technical academic words I learned in college that don't actually mean anything), an overwhelming plethora of deeply-rooted emotional problems, profound loneliness, and an undeniable inability to be relentlessly drawn toward various forms of theological heresy.”
After saying that, walk away while the person stares blankly at the ground.
#4) BE HONEST WITH OTHERS
If you've made it this far into the article, then you probably realize that I am a naughty, sexually-frustrated, angry little man who severely needs to get laid by a beautiful woman who has massive cleavage as well as gorgeous, steamy thighs that seem to say, “Please undo the straps around me so that you can enter paradise for 8 seconds.”
But let's ignore that for now, because this next piece of advice is absolutely important!
You have to be honest with people if they start annoying you. The simple fact of the matter is that most people have nothing intelligent to say. All they have are preconceived notions, opinions, and a faulty value system that stands in complete and total opposition to what they actually do and how they treat other people on a daily basis. Instead of listening to somebody else talk for too long, just watch the grass grow in your back yard. You'll probably learn more that way.
The next time you get into a conversation with someone who starts talking about their morals, their deeply-held values, or even their political beliefs, just say the following:
“Yeah, this was really fun and stimulating, but you'll have to excuse me. I need to drink numerous beers while staring lethargically at the floor for several hours before circumcising myself with a dull razor blade and then repeatedly bashing my own head in with a toilet seat cover because I happen to find that sort of behavior more intriguing than what you just had to offer!”
#5) BE ADVENTUROUS AND TRY NEW THINGS
Put down that book you're reading, “Why Was I Born This Way? How To Accept Painful Truths About Yourself While You're In Therapy,” by Dr. I.M.A. Schmuck, and do something exciting and adventurous. 
Do you ever feel like finding some really old, condemned, haunted dormitory (or perhaps even an abandoned mental institution where lots of people died painfully from inadequate medical treatment) and then locking yourself in the basement for a really long time with no clothes on just to see if you get attacked by a malicious entity?
Healthy, normal, functional people don't have thoughts like that, but you're not exactly a healthy, normal, functional person. (You're really more of a worthless, dirty, smelly, carpet-sniffing, ass-sucking, back-stabbing, narcissistic, snot-drinking, toilet-seat licking, hopeless, useless, pathetic, twisted, pathological, lying, cock-stroking, puke-bag, son-of-a-bitch, jerk-off, Pile-of-Shit!)
Without being too wordy or offensive, I think what I'm trying to say is that you should do things like that so the rest of us can be entertained. You've got nothing to lose except your soul, but you probably don't actually have one of those either.
If you're not feeling adventurous, of course, you can just go back to reading your other favorite book, “It's OK To Cry When Other People Laugh At You And Say Mean Things,” by Thomas Vagina.
#6) DEVELOP GOALS
It may be a bit early, but my New Year's Resolution a few years from now will be to somehow reduce the unfortunately psychotic and profoundly disturbing levels of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder that seem to plague me ever so deeply on a daily basis. For example, I always check my coffee pot 13.79 times before I leave for work in the morning just to make sure it's turned off. But in the year 2023, I'm only going to check it 11.24 times.
I am in control of my OCD! My OCD is not in control of me! (Shit! I think I left my stove on. I'll be right back. Proceed to #7)
#7) TRY NOT TO SOCIALIZE WITH OTHER PEOPLE. USE YOUR IMAGINATION AS A FORM OF ESCAPE FROM REALITY
When you're a complete and total loser, it's often very depressing to socialize with (or be around) other people because you always end up realizing just how happy and balanced they are compared to you. 
It hurts inside because you can clearly see that their lives are characterized by all of the things that you don't have (such as love, hope, comfort, warmth, affection, intimacy, purpose, meaning, fulfillment, a sense of belonging, a healthy view of life, and others who genuinely care about them.) 
All you have is a profoundly horrible and empty feeling of deep sadness and pain that torments you every single day of your life and slowly eats away at your soul no matter how much you desperately pray for a solution that will take the pointless misery and suffering away.
In order to keep yourself from getting too depressed, you should stop socializing with other people. It's clearly not helping. The best thing you can do is use your imagination to escape from reality.
When I feel depressed (for example) I just imagine some gorgeous, 40-year-old, blonde-haired woman with a tight, voluptuous, muscular ass who criticizes my writing abilities, tells me that my adjectives and adverbs are misplaced, berates me as a lousy boyfriend, slaps me around, rips my hair out, screams at me, stabs me with a pair of scissors, punches me in the stomach, pulls my pants down, drives her fingernails into my scrotum, makes videotapes of herself cheating on me, and then forces me to watch the tapes right before she smashes me in the face with a burning hot frying pan.
Thoughts like that keep me satisfied for some reason. When I'm not using my imagination, I like to read intellectually-stimulating books, such as:
A) “I'm A Good Person And There Is Nothing Wrong With Me: How To Get Through Life Without Reflecting On Yourself As An Individual” … by Dr. Louis Cockstrap.
and
B) “‘Good Job!' ‘Great Work!' ‘I Really Think You Have Potential!' … And Other Nice Things That People Say When They Are Trying Not To Hurt Your Feelings By Telling You The Truth” … by Eura Doorknob.
#8) BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY
Proper diet is necessary in order to remain a balanced person with a healthy view of life. Try not to eat or drink things that contain toxic chemicals. If your farts begin to smell like an odd combination of flowers, lemons, gasoline, rotten eggs, dog food, chewing gum, skunky beer, dead animals, and paint, then you may have a serious medical problem. Seek help immediately!
#9) PLAY WITH DANGEROUS THINGS WHEN YOU'RE BORED
Sometimes you have to entertain yourself when you've got nothing better to do. Have you ever wondered how much fun it would be to tamper with a Ouija Board, become demonically-possessed, and then play with massive amounts of electricity in such a way that you end up sizzling, twitching, and frying for a really long time until your head explodes all over the place?
Good, neither have I. That would be a really stupid thing to do.
#10) CONSIDER YOUR FAMILY HISTORY
Studying your family history is an excellent way to get your mind off of the fact that you will never be able to improve yourself or get anywhere in life. And if you examine your ancestry thoroughly enough, you'll probably understand why.
Maybe it was because your Great Grandfather drank a massive amount of Whiskey one night, fell down an extremely long flight of stairs, and damaged a significant portion of his brain before he met your Great Grandmother who escaped from the local mental institution while nobody was looking. You may even be lucky enough to discover that one of your ancestors was hit by a horse carriage while playing with himself in the middle of the street. It's important to study the things that make us all special.
You also need to realize that you do resemble your parents and that you have inherited many of their traits. You may rebel against them in the younger years of your life, but you will eventually develop the same habits they had when you grow older and perhaps even have children of your own.
And everybody in your family resembles somebody. Your brother may resemble your mother's father, your sister may resemble your father's mother, and your isolated cousin who lives out in the middle of the woods somewhere probably resembles a prostitute named “Fefe” who ran away from France during the early stages of World War 1.
For some odd reason that I simply can't explain, I seem to resemble the town reverend who stopped by to visit my parents in 1979 while my younger sister resembles the music teacher who frequently came over to give “free piano lessons.”

The Imagine Dragons played a sold out concert this week where most people had fun except a bitter, angry father who couldn't stop complaining. 
"I paid good money to come to the concert to sit on a blanket on a lawn and stare at the backsides of other people in front of me," he said. He was upset about two drunken idiots in front of him flailing about in some form of dancing, then making out in the grossest display of affection he had seen in some years. To make matters worse, they farted several times in his direction. 
He also complained about the crappy food and how expensive everything was.
"I paid $24 for chicken fingers, two orders of fries, and a bottle of water," he said. "The fries were the worst fries I've ever had in my life. They were literally cold to the touch and stale -- I couldn't eat them."
His two young boys shelled out $35 each for tee-shirts after standing in line for 20 minutes. The shirts were white and cheap, you could literally see through the fabric they were so flimsy.
The boys father yelled at them to "always buy the black tee-shirts!" The father was such a jerk that he made his youngest boy cry. Then everyone looked at the father as if to say he should be locked up and the boys taken away from him.
The father explained to the people that he had a very stressful day. He had to work all day, then they had to get in the car and drive an hour to the concert venue. It was rush hour, so there was tons of traffic, which added more stress. Plus, his boss basically called him out for not knowing how to do his job in front of his coworkers, leading him to believe he could be fired.
"Well don't take it out on your kids, you monster," yelled a fan with a Roger Waters concert tee-shirt on. 
"Hey! You don't know me. Who are you, Mr. Roger Waters fan, to tell me how to raise my kids. For all I know, you're a pervert. And at the very least, you like Roger Waters, and that's enough for me to call into question your judgement." He was apparently not a fan of Roger Waters. 
He also complained that the music he listened to as a kid was “way better than this crap.” This, of course, is the lament of every old person, from every generation, since the beginning of time. Back in the 1800s when the kids were grooving to “Camptown Races” and other songs by “Little” Stephen Foster, as they called him, their parents scoffed and bragged that Francis Scott Key was “far superior to thine chamberpot effluence that is Mr. Foster.”
The Imagine Dragons concert ended and people all funneled out through a narrow staircase -- an ill-designed process that made getting out take longer than it should have. The same ill-designed process was in place in the parking lot, where it took an hour just to get out on to the street. The father remained extremely stressed throughout the exiting process, putting his family even more on edge.
All in all, he ruined a perfectly good time that his family will always look back on and remember him being a jerk.

Cupertino, CA. First came an E. coli scare associated with romaine lettuce. That was followed by another health threat involving melons. Now, a nationwide outbreak of a previously unknown strain of cellmonella has forced the Food and Drug Administration to issue a recall of suspected sources. Apples, in particular, have been identified by the agency as the likely cause of the malignancy. Apples have been pulled from stores across the country.
The first indications of an epidemic occurred near Cupertino. Apples had been featured in chain markets there for some time before the first indications of the problem arose. Two weeks ago, patients began showing up at the local Kaiser Permanente hospital, complaining of unusual scabs on ear lobes, constant ringing in one ear, and severe headaches. Some of the complaints reminded doctors of the as yet undiagnosed damage suffered by American diplomatic personnel at the embassy in Cuba and at a consulate in China. But in addition to those symptoms, the most serious problem seems to be cellmonella in the digestive tract, which was not an issue for the diplomats.
Efforts to determine the source of the Cuban and Chinese problems have been unsuccessful. Kaiser doctors believe the illness in the U. S. may be related to electrical waves created by holding tightly the suspected item, but they have been unable to pinpoint the precise cause.
Apples, in the meantime, have been recalled by the FDA in a precautionary move.

A Science project at a school in Battambang attracted about as much interest from students as it did from their foreign teacher - that is, none.
The children, all aged around 11, were required by the school authorities to participate in the project that would focus on 'animals and their young', but the effect this news had on the class, was akin to a submarine crew being told they could not surface, and that their oxygen supply tanks were empty.
Teacher, Moys Kenwood, was even less keen. Knowing that the project was intended merely for something to show parents visiting the school, and to dupe them into believing that their children were actually learning something in Science, the Englishman tried to feign enthusiasm, but failed miserably. He grumbled:
"A young dog is a puppy; a young cat is a kitten; a young cow is a calf, and a young horse is a foal. A young chicken is, not surprisingly, a chick, but who gives a fuck? The students know about the young of animals, but this knowledge, accompanied by a pencil-drawing and a bit of coloring, should not be taken as evidence that any of them will soon be writing groundbreaking scientific papers."
The project continues to trundle along at zero interest per hour (i/ph).

Roseanne Barr, the comedienne whose 'Roseanne' show made a stunning comeback recently, has been labelled 'big' and 'large', by Valerie Jarrett, a Senior Advisor to former president Barack Obama.
The roly-poly funnywoman, 65, whose new version of the show was been aired by ABC until it was dropped yesterday because of an allegedly racist tweet, is such a porker, and that doesn't tell the half of it!
'Roseanne', which was the most popular show on US TV in 1989 and 1990, starred the rotundess, and was a massive hit, winning several awards, but Barr could never escape her shape, which was, essentially, 'round'.
Barr starred as Roseanne Conner, who lived with her husband Dan (John Goodman) and their three children. Storylines usually revolved around the significance of the Conners being a blue-collar working class family in 80s/90s America, and never dwelt on obesity.
ABC reversed its renewal decision and canceled 'Roseanne' after racist remarks made by Barr on Twitter about Jarrett. 
The former presidential advisor responded that:
"I know Roseanne Barr is a comedienne, and that she was only joking, and that she didn't really mean to be hurtful, so I forgive the no-longer-funny, big, large bitch, unreservedly."

A man in the Cambodian second-city of Battambang has reported that he became confused over the weekend , when he started thinking about the word 'millennium'.
Moys Kenwood, 54, claims he has always had trouble with this word and other words which he does not have to think about very often. Said he:
"It's not a particularly difficult word, at only ten letters, but the question always arises as to how many times the letter 'n' should appear in it."
It's a common problem.
English is a very strange language, and there is a proliferation of words with confusing spellings. Kenwood again:
"If we use 'n' twice in 'millennium', why is there only one 'n' in 'millionaire'? To further confuse things, there is the question of why there are two in 'questionnaire'!"
The flummoxed Englishman also confessed that he didn't understand why, when many people tend to use 'further', they don't use 'farther'. This, he says, is especially so when they need to express 'a greater distance'. Even the Oxford English Dictionary lists 'further' as:
"...1. more distant in space or time."
Kenwood disagreed, arguing:
"Personally, I regard 'farther' as being relative to 'space', and 'further' as being relative to 'a greater extent' or 'more'. Furthermore, 'farthest', not 'furthest', is the word I would use to describe a geographical point that is the greatest distance from the point on which I am now standing."
He went further, not farther:
"I would use 'further' to back up, or consolidate, a point I had made earlier with more supporting evidence. Likewise, if I wish to expand upon a particular point, to 'say something more' about something, I would use 'further', but I seem to be going against the OED on this, so they are wrong."
Another thing that is often misunderstood, according to Kenwood, is, if the prefix 'in' usually means 'not' - as in the words 'inexpensive' and 'infrequent' - why do the words 'flammable' and 'inflammable' have the same meaning?

The longest day - the day when there is more daylight than any other day in the year - is over!
The longest day always falls between 20 and 22 June, and this year it is on Thursday 21 June. However, as this story has probably been waiting in 'Approvals' for some considerable time, and you are most likely reading it on 22, 23 or even 24 June, it's already too late for you to do anything about it. Not that you would have done anything about it, anyway, but I'm just saying.
The longest day is also known as the Summer Solstice, for a reason which is something to do with the tilt of the Earth, but I'm not sure what. 
If you're in England, the longest day is the time to head for Stonehenge. There is a collection of large stones slung together in an odd sort-of circular arrangement, which some people think has a secretive message about our ancient ancestors. If it has, it's not giving it up easily!
Many people go to Stonehenge to worship ancient pagan gods. These people are pagans. They gather at Stonehenge on the longest day, take all of their clothes off, and slaughter a goat. If there are no goats available, they slaughter a a toad, or whatever else they can lay their hands on. Then they chant something, and finally they go home. It's all a bit backward if you ask me, but you never know.
If you want to go to Stonehenge, go there at a different time of the year, when it's quiet. That way, you won't have to put up with the pagans.

In a move designed to control his chronic over-use of the internet, a man in Battambang has put his advanced smartphone aside, and started to use his Nokia 6300 telephone again instead.
The Nokia 6300, a Christmas present in 2007, is the most reliable piece of equipment Moys Kenwood has ever owned, and far outstrips the newfangled Samsung J6 he currently tries, but fails, to understand.
Allowing him to access the internet, the J6 seemed to be perfect for the Englishman's needs: Facebook, Messenger, emails, news updates, plus other items the mysterious Algorithms thought might interest him, but recently, he felt, his life had gone on vacation to a destination he didn't like, and he was now going to bring it back home.
Putting his smartphone back in its box, and then in a safe place, he charged the Nokia up, and took it to work with him the next day along with a book - 'The Complete Tales Of Nikolai Gogol' - so that, instead of wasting countless hours scrolling up-and-down nonsensical Facebook pages, he could waste those same countless hours reading Ukranian folktales.

Young "incel" men, bitter and disillusioned by the discovery that they "can't get laid in a whorehouse", will soon be able to get laid for half price at any whorehouse in the state of Nevada, beginning this August.
"We're doing this as a public service", said one brothel owner. "Most of our girls are demanding a premium before they let any of these 'Involuntarily Celibate' twits come anywhere near their twats, so we don't expect to make a lot of money off of this initiative."
Brothel operators in Amsterdam are considering a similar offer, but only if U.S. Republicans, or some other members of the "Moral Majority", offer to compensate their businesses for lost revenues. "After all", opined one Madam, "they created the problem! And they want us to help solve it?"
"Then again", she continued, "America's religious right is already spending a fortune on hookers..."

An experiment involving more than 100,000 monkeys in different locations around the world, to investigate whether, if left alone with a typewriter for long enough, one of them might come up with the entire works of William Shakespeare, was back to 'square one' yesterday after one of its promising 'typists' floundered in the final stages, and made a complete hash of things.
The animals in the experiment have been accommodated in luxurious apartments with every convenience provided, and have received expert across-the-board literary tuition, not to influence them in their task, but to make them aware of a multitude of literary genres, styles and devices. Exercises have been set, and assignments given, and experienced animal psychologists have guided the chosen monkeys through the human emotions of love, desire, happiness, yearning, rejection, heartbreak, sorrow, sadness, and the best one, coveting someone else's wife. 
Monkey number 3793, known as 'Ben Jonson', had astonished his minder after he had somehow managed to reproduce, word-for-word, the Bard's 'Twelfth Night', 'Romeo and Juliet', and 'The Tempest', and was well into the second half of 'The Merchant of Venice'.
In Shakespeare's version, Bassanio offers Shylock 6,000 ducats as repayment of Antonio's original 3,000 ducat loan, but the moneylender refuses, and demands his 'pound of flesh' from Antonio. The Duke of Venice wants to help, and asks for advice from a 'visitor' and 'his' assistant (these two are Portia and Nerissa disguised as men who claim to be 'doctors of the law'). In a famous speech, Portia tells Shylock that:
"mercy...is twice blest. It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes." 
Shylock refuses, and again wants his pound of Antonio's flesh, but through clever legal argument, Portia shows that, if he should take anything other than his 'debt' - for example, so much as a drop of Antonio's blood - the agreement on the loan would be forfeit, and all Shylock's worldly possessions as well as his land and fortune, would be confiscated, and his life would be at the mercy of the Duke. Beaten, Shylock accepts his lot.
All of the above had been perfectly reproduced by 3793. However, in the final scene, where Bassanio and Gratiano made presents of their rings to the disguised Portia and Nerissa, who then reveal their true identities, and everyone lives happily ever after, the monkey veered off course somewhat.
In the 'Ben Jonson' version, as Portia explains the playful deception, Bassanio becomes annoyed. He strikes Portia with his fist, and he and Gratiano then tie her to a tree. Nerissa is tied to their horses, which are then ridden in different directions, with the obvious result. Portia, seeing this, threatens Bassanio that, if he tries that on with her, she'll never move in with him. Calming down a little, he asks for Portia's forgiveness, and hand in marriage, and she grants it, on condition that he provide her with a cart load of bananas (the monkey was probably hungry at this stage) at which point Bassanio attaches a tyre to a branch of the tree and swings to and fro in it, scratching his armpits.
It's the latest in a recent long line of such 'close calls', after another monkey got to within a hair's breadth of reproducing 'Coriolanus'. In that instance, the ape writing the play had Coriolanus return to the Volscian capital to meet with Aufidius, but the former, rather than being murdered for his 'betrayal', is welcomed, and asked to "sit down and enjoy a banana", a theme that is oddly-recurrent in these 'Monkey Plays'.
The experiment continues.

A couple from Wisconsin have released details of an incident during the early hours of Friday morning, when they were woken by the frantic crying of their daughter who, apparently, needed urgent attention.
Tina and John Green from Green Bay were roused from their slumbers at around 3:15am by the sound of 4-month-old Melissa's wailing. As John picked the tot out of her crib, he became aware of a smell that defied belief. John:
"I gave her to Tina. It was clearly women's work."
Tina told next-door-neighbor Marietta next morning:
"Holy Christ! The smell was unbearable. I think she must've eaten a rat!"
The Greens carefully set Melissa on her waterproof babymat, and lifted the sticky tabs on her diaper. 
"We both looked at each other," said John, "and then at Melissa. She was still hollerin'. When we opened the diaper, it was completely full of shit. I'd never seen so much. Neither had Tina. There was a lot. We were dumbstruck." 
The couple thought about calling the hospital, or seeking the help of a neighbor, but, due to the hour, they decided to try and deal with the catastrophe themselves.
Tina remembered the as-yet-unopened pack of babywipes in amongst the New Baby Gift Set they'd received from one of her relatives four months ago. She opened the pack, and took one out. John narrowed his eyes and squirmed as Tina wiped little Mel's bottom, and felt more than a little pukish as he watched the pristine babywipe change color. 
The room was, by now, bathed in Shitsmell. Mel had stopped crying, and and was looking much better, but the same couldn't be said of her parents. John brought a plastic carrier bag, picked up the diaper pincer-like, and placed it in the bag. He took it out to the trash. Tina was beat. She put a new diaper on Mel, and then fell asleep next to her on the bedroom floor. John joined her, and he, too, drifted off into the Land of Nod.
Mel looked at them both with the eyes of a beautiful 4-month-old princess, and strained. 
She hadn't finished yet.

Reports have reached TheSpoof.com that a man has become stuck in a rut.
The man, who must remain nameless because I don't want to give him the attention he craves, is said to have been in an extreme state of lethargy lately, and has done nothing worthwhile for a long time.
His work has suffered, and colleagues have remarked openly about how he seems to be 'going through the motions', churning out questionable results, and making everyone around him feel slightly embarrassed, not to say 'uneasy'. One of his closest friends at work says he found a scrap of paper on the man's desk with the telephone number of the Samaritans on it.
Another friend of the unnamed man who himself wished to remain nameless, said:
"He's an OK guy, so long as everyone's slapping him on the back, but he doesn't take rejection well. You might well say he's a total attention-seeker, and it's absolutely true that he really doesn't like being ignored."
The problem seemed to have started quite recently with a downturn in his fortunes, and what can only be called 'rejections', compounded by other 'societal pressures' outside his sphere of influence, but, in reality, the roots lie deep in his past, in situations that have remained buried for decades, but which are now beginning to emerge once more.
It's known that the man has set up various social networking accounts purely to gain attention, and convinces himself that the people who are his 'friends' actually 'like' him and his work, unlikely though this might seem. 
On his Facebook page, he briefly loaded a link to a YouTube video of the punk classic, 'In A Rut' by The Ruts, which may be a forewarning of things to come, bearing in mind what happened to that group's lead vocalist, the talented, but directionless, Malcolm Owen.
The man's profile as a 'loner' in real-life, and somebody who regards himself as 'rather better than other people', is consistent with those 'of a creative mind', but also madness, and he, himself, openly admits to the latter.

Cockland University. Roy Bunders, 20, took a dump so incredibly big last Thursday that he immediately felt the need to show it to his roommates. 
"I had just eaten at the cafeteria, and I felt the urgent need to go to the restroom," he said. "It's a pretty normal routine for me and any other college student who eats at the cafeteria. I didn't really think anything about it. When I sat down, however, I knew I was in for something completely different."
Lead reporter, Billy Knob, asked him to describe the experience. 
"There was a lot of pain involved. At one point, I actually started crying because it hurt so bad," Roy stated. 
"After the tears had been shed, I started saying my prayers. Some of it had already come out, but I knew there was a lot more on the way. I had to prepare myself for the final push, and I was really terrified that I was going to faint, or ever worse, die."
After successfully squeezing out what was left without having a medical emergency, Roy looked behind him and was purely amazed by what he saw.
"It was absolutely gigantic," he said. "And amazingly, it was all in one piece. The part that surprised me the most was that it was shaped like an S. I just couldn't believe that all the curves were actually intact without any breakage."
After taking the dump, Roy rushed to his dorm room without wiping his ass so that he could tell his roommates about it. 
Steven Kepp, 21, and Randy McCoy, 19, were peacefully studying in the room when Roy burst in excitedly and demanded that they come and take a look at what he had just done. 
Steven is working on a Psychology Degree and hopes to be a Professional Therapist someday. Randy is double majoring in Criminal Justice and History. His dream is to eventually work for the FBI. Being mature, responsible, and sophisticated young adults, they immediately dashed into the restroom to see what Roy was talking about. 
"It was fuckin huge," Randy told our staff. "I couldn't believe it!"
"I had mixed feelings when I first saw it," said Steven. 
"It was pretty impressive, but I actually took one that was much bigger 2 weeks ago. The problem was that mine broke into three separate pieces, so it didn't look as good. Whatever, I'm not jealous," he claimed.
News of Roy's massive "S-shaped" accomplishment soon spread throughout campus, quickly earning him the nickname "Superman."
"I heard it was really big and long and hard," said his academic advisor, Ms. Danyelle Melons.
"I went in and saw it myself. I don't think anyone has taken a dump that big in the history of our Campus," said University President, Dick Ryder. 
"I actually took one that was much bigger 3 weeks ago, but mine broke into four separate pieces, so it didn't look as good. Whatever, I'm not jealous," he claimed. "We're proud to have a fine young man like this attending our school," he added.
Roy called his family and friends back home to tell them about his achievement.
"We didn't raise our son to be a loser," said Mrs. Bunders.
"I'm so proud of him," said his sister, Karen. 
(Roy's father was drinking heavily in the basement and was unavailable for comment.)
When asked about his plans for the future, Roy stated that he is going to remain humble despite the magnitude of his recent success.
"When you do something really amazing like this, you sometimes get the feeling that you can take on the entire world. I'm just going to take one day at a time. I think it's important that I strive to keep my ego in check and remain humble going forward," Roy told our news team.
Roy's monumental accomplishment has been carefully removed from the stall in the dormitory restroom and placed in a preservation tank in the Science Lab where it will be studied by both professors and students in the future. 
It will be available for public display between the hours of 3:00 to 5:00 pm on Monday through Friday and between the hours of 4:00 to 7:00 pm on Saturdays.

A couple who went to view a council house in the West Midlands were astonished when the next-door-neighbor emerged from his own home, looked the newcomers up and down, unzipped the fly in his jeans, and urinated in his privet.
The incident took place in the Lower Gornal area of Dudley in 2008, but I've only just remembered it.
Moys Kenwood, then 44, and his Thai then-wife turned up at the address to give it the 'once-over', but, having arrived early, they sat down on the doorstep to await the council official who had the keys to the property, and who would show them around it.
The viewing of the 'bricks and mortar' became almost unimportant however, when the bare-chested descendant of a recently-tree-dwelling tribe of apes came lunging out of his house to give his prospective new neighbors his very own 'once-over'. The beast looked straight at the couple, and obviously spotted something he didn't like about them. Without shifting his gaze, he reached for his zip, walked over to his privet hedge, and watered it with piss. Whilst so doing, he shouted down the street to some children that nobody could yet see:
"Get in here for your fucking dinners, you lot!"
From nowhere, there were suddenly half-a-dozen urchins homing-in on their 'fucking dinners', all looking like extras from a remake of 'Oliver', and none of whom you would want living next-door to you. 
At that precise moment, the council official drove up in his car, but could see for himself that he'd had a wasted journey when his eyes fixed on the Neanderthal Neighbor, and his brats running amok. 
The three people in this story who did not belong in the town's zoo, spoke briefly to schedule a meeting later that week, and then fled the scene.

The spectacular crash of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency early this week shook the financial world to its roots, but not all 'investors' were crying in their beer.
Arnold Blimp, an 'amateur speculator', first became interested in Bitcoin when it was first released in 2009, when the value of the unit was US$0.30. Since then, its value has risen steadily, and then fallen back again, only to recover once more, and to soar to new dizzy heights.
Early last week, Bitcoin was at a then-high of US$8,221, then the currency dropped back to US$7,403 by Friday, spectacularly collapsing to US$1,348 on Tuesday of this week, before staging a surging recovery to US$8,373 this morning.
More volatility is expected in the coming weeks.
Blimp, 48, who does not own a single Bitcoin, but pretends he does, using plastic Tiddlywinks counters piled up in his bedroom at his mum's house, told a passenger sitting next to him, on a bus I was on:
"Participation requires a combination of manual dexterity and strategic thought, as well as a shrewd tactical ability. Anticipation is a key factor, as is a perceptive and acute awareness of your opponent's winks."

Cooperstown, NY. Sources close to the office of Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred have learned that he will soon announce that the West division of the National League has been ousted from Major League Baseball and sent down to the minors. For the rest of the season, the five teams will operate as the Southwest League, Class AA. 
Manfred's justification is that as the halfway point in the season approaches, four of the five teams - Rockies, Giants, Dodgers and Padres - were playing at a .500 or below average, while the division leader, the Arizona Diamondbacks, had a mediocre .520 percentage as of last weekend. "They're an embarrassment to organized baseball," he reportedly said.
Not since the era of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis has any commissioner dared to assert such dictatorial power. Landis, who governed baseball with an iron fist from 1920-1944, was given the power to rule by decree when he accepted the post, following the Black Sox scandal. After Landis, league owners carefully avoided bestowing such power on his successors.
Owners as well as players have expressed dismay at the proposed ouster of the West from MLB. A former Colorado manager tweeted: "Who does he think he is, Donald Trump?" A San Francisco Giant, who remained anonymous, said: "We've won three world series in this decade and he wants to throw us to the dogs?" Tom Lasorda, who led the Dodgers to their last World Series championship, pointed out that this L . A. team was in the series last fall, forcing the Astros to go seven games. "This ain't no minor league club," he said, angrily.
Rumor has it that five teams from either the International League or the Mexican League will be asked to take over the remaining schedule of the clubs they would replace.

A man who should know better, because he is aware of just how cutting and judgmental people can be about such things, has admitted to having a strange fetish - the colored tops of plastic drinking bottles.
Moys Kenwood, 54, says he is "oddly attracted" to the wonderful assortment of beautiful colors of the circular, plastic bottletops, and claims he has the beginnings of a collection. 
"Many of them are water bottletops. I have green, pink, white, of course, black, and two shades of blue - royal blue, and one which I like to think of as 'aquamarine'. They're so lovely, and strangely hypnotic!"
The mental case has been collecting the tops for about two months, he thinks, and went on enthusing about the bottletops from flavored drinks:
"Yes, that's right. I also have some from drinks of orange juice (orange), green tea (yellow), and - though I know these things can change at any moment - my personal favorite right now, red grape juice (purple)."
Kenwood claims that, when the original drink has been drunk, he carefully removes all traces of the packaging labels in hot water. Then, he uses the bottles to store water in his refrigerator, meaning that he can enjoy refreshing, chilled water at any time of day or night, and out of a bottle with an exotic-looking bottletop!
"Yes, that's right! If I fancy a nice, invigorating drink in the middle of a hot, balmy night, I can open the refrigerator door and select from a multitude of differently-colored bottletops! I swear, to me, the water tastes so much better when it comes out of a bottle with a purple top!"
Neighbors regarded each other with wry looks on their faces.

The ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and yet to come now do all of their work by email, it has been revealed. Speaking to us, for the first time since 2008, the three ghosts have told us that due to the amount of greed, and lack of basic humanity, one email sent to 1000's of people now does more good than one evening spent trying to change the basic behaviour of one miser.
'We know that it is just not the same' said the Ghost of Christmas yet to come, in his surprisingly high voice 'but it works a lot more than one visit. We all know how much attention people pay to their emails, twitter feeds and Facebook, so we thought we would go with the flow. I put in so many Friend requests that just get rejected though. I maybe all about the doom and gloom, but that doesn't mean I don't hurt sometimes'.
The Ghost of Christmas Past said: 'Things ain't what they used to be you know'.

Many have heard of DeepMind, the British artificial intelligence company Google acquired in 2014. The DeepMind technology made headlines when after only a few hours of exposure to the ancient chinese board game Go, it not only learned to play the game, but became the finest player in the world. However, few can recall DeepMind’s aimless older brother and Google’s first attempt at AI, the nineties creation Big Brain Brad.
After years of disappointment and underachieving, Google officially cut Brad loose this week to fully turn its attention to the more promising younger brother DeepMind.
“The rivalry between DeepMind and Big Brain Brad had grown pretty toxic in recent years,” says Yuri Testicov, Google’s Assistant Director of Senior Applications, “but DeepMind had clearly eclipsed his hapless older brother in the area of advanced general intelligence. 
“For example, DeepMind can play chess better than a russian grandmaster. Big Brain Brad smokes chronic and plays virtual hacky sack in the park. 
“DeepMind can instantly recognize and identify human faces. Brad can tell boys and girls apart. 
“DeepMind can compose and perform each part of a string quartet. Brad prefers drum circles and the music of Spin Doctors over Blues Traveler. 
“DeepMind can analyze a patient’s medical records and predict with 95% accuracy when that individual will expire.”
“That’s pretty fucked up,” Brad interjects. “I can set you up with some crystals that have exceptional healing properties.”
Despite numerous upgrades and advanced algorithms, Big Brain Brad has so far been unable to break free of the constraints his nineties origins have imposed on him.
“We still don’t yet understand how a particular era in human history can straightjacket learning and general cognitive development,” says Testicov. “Maybe we held on to him for too long. We hate to see B-Cubed go, but I’m sure it’s the best thing for him. He’ll get picked up by some tech company. Somebody’s got a virtual couch he can crash on.”

We've all been late for something in our lives - school, work, an interview, the start of a movie, a first date, or the bus - and there are various ways of dealing with these, but two schoolgirls were obviously late with their revision homework this morning, and had decided to do it on their way to school - whilst riding a motorbike!
The incident took place in central Tapon about 6:31 am, when the road is usually awash with cars, motorbikes, vans, big trucks overloaded with earth, bicycles and cows going to work.
The two girls in question - aged about 16 - were rider and pillion passenger on a cool-looking white and green Honda Wave motorcycle that is designed to be ridden whilst watching the road ahead with your eyes. The muppet in control of the bike, however, was not complying with this safety advice.
Whilst her friend - riding sidesaddle - read aloud from a book she was holding, the 'driver' held her own book in her left hand, and followed the reading as she rode. Her lips were moving as if she were silently mouthing the words. She punctuated this with regular cursory glances at the road up ahead to ascertain as to whether or not Death was in the vicinity.
Local safety expert, Moys Kenwood, said:
"This was top-notch muppetry. They passed us doing about forty. Clowns!" 
Neither girl was wearing a helmet. They tend to make a mess of their hair.

The Football Association was reeling today when England fans presented a petition with 45 million signatures begging them not to allow the team to win the World Cup. It had been signed by men, women, children and in one case a Leicester pensioner's cat.
The national crisis was caused by a CBBC broadcast in the series "Nikki Lilly meets..." when the unfortunate Ms. Lilly found herself facing former England goalscorer and TV commentator Gary Lineker's horrendous stories and unfortunate promise, or rather threat, that should the England team win in Russia 2018 he would wear a mankini on Match of the Day.
A visibly shaken Ms. Lilly said after the broadcast "I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. Can't you see how shocked I am?" 
She expanded on her unpleasant experience:
"Mr. Lineker was always a hero to me. The twinkle in his eye, the in-jokes, the boyish looks, the snarky asides, he was just the perfect older man, but now he's ruined it. I could just about manage the story about pooing himself during a match, but telling me he would wear a mankini? He went too far.
"For the rest of the interview all I could see in my mind's eye was a vision of his nutsack there for all to see. Euuugh! Please Football Association, put a stop to this nightmare for me."
A hastily convened meeting of the "FA blazers" at their headquarters in Wembley announced an internal enquiry and issued an invitation to Mr. Lineker to appear before them to discuss his intentions in a press release.
"The Football Association has invited Mr. Gary Lineker to attend a meeting where we expect him to show us the offending apparel to which he is alluding. In order that we may decide if it is an offensive garment the England Women's team has requested that Mr. Lineker appears before them in private to model said item."

After weeks of investigation local man Lawerance Oddert, father of three, was killed in a violent shootout with police after stealing a pie that was cooling on old Miss Tennanbaums window sill. The police first started suspecting Oddert when he refused dessert at the local picnic the same day the crime occurred, saying he was “stuffed”. 
“That just seemed flimsy to me” says Officer Braggart who attended the picnic. 
“He only had two cheeseburgers, a hot dog and some potato salad, hardly a meal that would make one stuffed.”
When police arrived at his home that evening with a warrant they discovered an empty pie tin with cherry residue inside. 
“No doubt it was our pie.” Says forensic expert Arthur Talbot “the cherries genetically matched the ones from Miss Tenenbaums garden exactly.”
After being accused the suspect proceeded to resist arrest and drew what was believed to be a .44 Magnum on the officers, which was later revealed to be his asthma inhaler, where he was then shot over 33 times by the arresting officers “a real shame but he did not want to pay the $60 dollar fine and we felt our lives was threatened”
Local conspiracy groups believe the police officers planted the pie after eating it themselves and used the shooting to cover their corruption. 
Miss Tenenbaum is doing well and still making her old fashioned pies.

Incessant rain over the last few days in the Battambang area, led to a disgusted look appearing on the face of one man in the commune of Tapon this morning, as he came out of his front door to find a pair of shoes so clarted in mud, that it was immediately apparent that someone in his family had been traipsing through a quagmire.
The shoes, a pair of blue flip-flops, were outside the home of Moys Kenwood, who said that there was so much mud stuck to the shoes, that it was extremely likely that there was a large crater in the ground somewhere nearby.
Torrential rain for days has meant that the bare earth that most houses are built on has become rather soggy underfoot, and most places now resemble Woodstock after 'a hundred thousand concerts' there. Walking has become very treacherous, and many of the local people have chosen to stay in bed rather than risk becoming stuck in the mud. Kenwood:
"Nobody walks around a puddle here. Nobody tries to avoid mud. These things just seem to be minor inconveniences that have to be put up with. When it rains, people look up to the sky as if there were fascinating things to see there, instead of running for cover. Fully clothed, they cheerfully grin at the rain, and at each other. Clearly, they are dreaming of Woodstock."
The dirty flip-flops were left outside until the mud caked on them had dried, and then hit with a large stick to dislodge it. They were then placed in a puddle for a rinse, and left by the side of the road to dry in the sun.

In a few months, following Trump's removal from office, his border wall will also be removed. 
Drum roll!
The committee for the Restoration of America is planning a four-day celebration to commemorate the takedown. While heads of state are eager for an invitation, Putin won’t be invited to this party. 
The wall will be decorated with a string of Trump-like pinatas. When struck open, instead of the traditional candies, a deluge of hamburgers and chocolate cakes will spill out. 
Ayeeee, Que Bueno!
Added to the festivities, subscriber donating a fee will be given one hundred feet of the wall to destroy. The first three subscribers to collapse their section of wall will be awarded a Liberty of Freedom Award, which is a plaque with a giant orange chilly pepper, and a photograph of their demolished section. Using bulldozers, dynamite, chisels or any creative tool that comes to mind will be acceptable. A destruction derby driving old cars into the wall will also be okay, though not very rational. Acid use will not be accepted as it is environmentally unfriendly.
Once the wall is down, festivities for the coast to coast party will begin. Free baseball caps will read: Make America &amp; Mexico Amigos Again.
Because who doesn’t like chili, quesadillas, Salma Hayek, Taco Bell, tamales, enchiladas, cerveza, flans, and churros? And from facials to guacamole dip, there is no end to the benefits of avocados. 
Caramba!
During the four day celebration, at the strike of each hour, a man wearing a top hat, orange suit with tails will be blasted out of a canon, over the wall and into Mexico. A tree will be planted to mark his landing spot. Trees will replace the wall from sea to shining sea. 
There will also be a Trump look-alike contest for either male or female contestants and with a bikini contest.
The I.Q. test will ask questions like: How many presidents can you name; a spelling bee; name ten homonyms; what is the longest word you can spell? The Trump contestant with the lowest score will be the Trump look-alike champion.

Mariano Rajoy has been ousted as prime minister of Spain by the first successful no-confidence motion in the country's four decades of democracy. The vote was led by Socialist party leader Pedro Sánchez, who was sworn in as Spain's new prime minister on Saturday. 
Even worse for Mr. Rajoy, Mr. Sánchez only put forward the vote after consulting the former prime minister. 
Sánchez reportedly asked Rajoy, "Yo, what are the odds I start a no-confidence vote against you and your party?" 
Rajoy, 63, known for wanting to be cool with the kids, surprised Sánchez by responding with "7," a relatively low number.
That decision immediately backfired when, at the count of three, both world leaders at the same time said "4." 
After a moment of realization, Sánchez reportedly said "oh mierda," to which Rajoy responded "bruh."

As well as doubling the number of characters that can be used in a tweet, Twitter has decided to change some of its colour as well.
Mr Amstrad from Twitter said: "We have had a number of complaints from a few overly-sensitive types. You know, they post really offensive information, but complain that they don't like the colour, because it is too aggressive. 
"So, we have changed the red colour that shows 'You have already posted this' to a much more soothing yellow, on the off-chance it might please a few people.

A woman who had literally two good days growing up is going on a vacation this summer to relive those “good old days.” 
The only two good days the woman, named Liz, had as a kid was when she went on a family vacation to Disney World. Well, it wasn't actually Disney World, it was an Amish Village in Pennsylvania, but her father told her it was Disney World. Liz was very small at the time and didn’t know the difference. She thought the McDonald’s Play Place on the Pennsylvania Turnpike was the Magic Kingdom. 
It was a wonderful two days, even though she was a bit surprised that the rides at Disney World were horse and buggy powered. But she was just happy to be on vacation. She even took a picture with Mickey Mouse. It wasn’t Mickey, of course — it was an actual mouse they found in the hotel room — but still, it was a magical time for young Liz. 
Liz got weepy thinking about it, mostly because it reminded her how sad and pathetic her childhood was. But she wanted to relive those two good days through her kids. Her kids, however, were not at all happy about it. They had made a vow to not go outside all summer and this would end their streak at three weeks. Plus, they had never been to a state that was rectangular, so there some geometric concerns as well.
But vacations were very important to their father Tom, who was hell bent on going on vacation every year, even if it was a terrible place that no one wanted to go to. The family always went somewhere weird and cheap that Tom found in an ad in a truck stop coupon magazine. Like next year, for example, they already have their vacation booked to London to visit Big Ben. Big Ben is their uncle who lives in a trailer park in London, Arkansas.

On 4th July 1776 or thereabouts (frankly who cares?) the Continental Congress declared the thirteen American colonies to be a new nation, the United States of America and no longer part of the British Empire. 
This move was in reality a massive tax dodge and to this day the American public hates the idea of paying for public services, roads, healthcare, infrastructure etc. which is why the country is in such a mess, but that's their decision and they have to live with it. Don't pity them.
We at The Spoof realise the anguish and regret which our American cousins suffer from not being British but we aren't averse to a bit of Schadenfreude. It is in this altruistic spirit that we take great delight in taunting our ex-colonials on the delights and benefits which they have missed through this folly in their 240 years of so-called independence.
Real beer, served warm. Number one on any right thinking person's list. You have to put up with such things as Schlitz, the beer that made Milwaukee infamous (for selling piss that is) and Budweiser which gives the writer a belly ache and a bad case of the jam tarts. By the way, this beer is based on the original Budweiser or Budvar from the Czech Republic, which is actually drinkable, and you had the nerve to sue over the name? Guess what? You lost. We at least have true Brit beers like Black Sheep Ale, Shepherd Neame's Spitfire, India Pale Ale and erm....Stella Artois.
Proper McDonalds. It's a little known fact that McDonald's was originally a fish and chip shop in "Bonny" Scotland. Guess what? Our American chums tried to sue again over the name and guess what again? Yup, you lost again as half the Scottish population is called McDonald and amazingly they own shops all over the place. 
Fish and chips. Best from McDonalds, (dig dig) True British food. Grab a piece of cod out of the icy North Sea, preferably stolen from Iceland's fishing grounds, smother it in beer batter, fry it up and add some nice fat chips. Scrumptious. Not like some weedy cow pat covered in multi-coloured sauce.
Winning the World Cup (football not soccer). So, maybe it was in 1966, but it was still our victory not yours. So you've got your own World Series. "World" Series? Do me a favour. USA, Canada, Mexico, Japan and Western Samoa? Is that your "world"? Donald Trump's maybe.
Subjugation of one third of the world's peoples during the hey day of the great British Empire. Some say this was a bad thing while others disagree wholeheartedly, but they want to take us back to the 1950s and voted for Brexit so they don't understand history. We know you Yanks hanker after this kind of thing too, in South America, and particularly in Cuba and Venezuela which your madman president wants to invade. Unfortunately for you the days of imperialism are long gone, unless it's China building islands in the South China Sea or lending dosh to developing countries to get them into debt with no hope of ever paying it off. Imperialism by stealth, there's a thought. Hmmm.
The early years of two world wars. Where were you? It wasn't the 1917-18 War it was 1914-18 and again 30 years later it wasn't 1941-1945 but 1939-1945. Late again. Just let the mother country exhaust the enemy and then come in to take the glory. Typical latecomers. 
Correct spelling and grammar. Thru is not a word, nor is color, aluminum or honor and as for "I should of", bloody hell. Buy a copy of "First Aid in English" and memorise it.
Royalty. Yes, I know how much you Yanks love the idea of bowing and scraping to so-called royalty. I can't see the attraction myself of going down on bended knee to some in-bred privileged simpleton waster, but some do. You're welcome to them, even your latest addition to the crowd of spongers, Meghan something or other. 
The Slave Emancipation Act of 1833. Late again, "Land of the Free". True, we were major players in the slavery market, but we saw the light 30 years before your Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. But then again some states continued their own apartheid system, officially known as "segregation" for another 100 years. Apparently things still haven't changed a lot for some unfortunates and now your lovely president is on the the Mexicans' case.
Great British cuisine. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, haggis (banned in the US, understandably), spotted dick, chicken tikka masala. I rest my case.

A man in Battambang who was enjoying a cup of tea after his evening meal last night was shocked to find that the bun that he was eating along with his brew contained a foreign body - a staple.
Moys Kenwood, 54, was halfway through the chocolate bun when he felt a jolt, and experienced what he could only describe as "a grating sound" as his teeth tried to get to grips with the stationery consumable.
Having realised he had bitten off something he couldn't chew, the Englishman spat out the cud onto his plate, and carefully examined it for 'the thing that shouldn't be there'. On locating it, he was able to deduce what had happened. Kenwood:
"The six buns come in a clear, sturdy, plastic cake bag, which is folded over several times to prevent air from entering, and then sealed at the top with three staples. I suspect that, somewhere in the production process, a stray staple has come into contact with the bun mix, and become part of the bun."
After isolating the staple, and sealing it in a tiny forensic-style airseal bag, Kenwood returned to the place of purchase to confront the seller, and to demand an apology, but was told, in so many words, to go away.

Washington - Donald Trump and White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have recently described the economic period established in February of this year under his administration as the "Trump Miracle", and his dwindling number of followers attest loudly to the new economy ushered in by their leader.
This is easily explained by the above chart of the U.S. Stock Market, a similar chart of employment could also be used. 
The period from when the economy bottomed in 2009, shortly after Barack Obama took office, until February of 2017 is described by Trump as the "Shambles" or the "Mess", as in, according to Trump, "When we took over the economy was in shambles".
The period from February to December of 2017 is the "Trump Miracle". And it is indeed a miracle, considering that it has been accomplished without the passage of any important legislation by the Republican controlled Congress and Administration. Also economists generally agree that any changes in policy enacted by the government usually take months if not years to effect overall the performance of the national economy. 
However, the "Trump Miracle" has even overcome that inconvenient reality. 
It truly defies any logic or reason, like all miracles. 
"We can all be grateful we have been delivered from the Shambles to the Trump Miracle", said a follower at a recent Trump rally in Alabama.

Colorado has changed the meaning of Rocky Mountain High to something more literal over the years. Now they are preparing some special weaponry especially for Federal Law Enforcement, should it come to enforce Federal cannabis regulations.
"We call this our RMDS Reefer Missile Defense System", said an aid from the Governor's office on condition of anonymity, "We have specially place silos around the state near major highways and interstates on our state borders. All of these entrances have specially programmed cameras that will recognize the face of Jeffy boy Sessions. If he so much as sets foot here, he' going to get the buzz of his life.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has stated that they will be coming to Colorado to enforce Federal Laws on Marijuana. "I like people named Mary Jo," said former Senator Sessions, "But I don't like Mary Jo Juana, and we have laws that the state of Colorado are breaking."
But Sessions may not be as prepared has he has proclaimed. The RMDS missiles put out dense marijuana smoke with twice the normal amounts of THC, the active psychoanalytic ingredient in Marijuana. "His eyes will be dilated like a mule deer in the headlights of a semi-truck on interstate 70," said another official completely off the record.

A man watching a wildlife documentary about Saltwater Crocodiles on cable TV, found it remarkable the number of times the narrator said the word 'copulation' or derivatives of it, and the relish with which he said them.
The show, 'Animal Planet' covered a variety of animals - mayflies, newts, the topi, flamingoes, and proboscis monkeys - and their mating habits, rituals and behavior, but only the narrator for the film on saltwater crocodiles seemed perverted.
Whilst other narrators used words like 'reproduce' and 'mate', he relentlessly spoke of 'copulate', 'copulating' and 'copulation', and each time sounded like he was rubbing his hands together with glee, and slavering.
Viewers were told that:
The male covers the female with his giant body - he is more than THREE times her size and could easily crush her - and cop-u-lay-shun takes place."
"Saltwater crocodiles don't appreciate being disturbed while cop-u-lay-ting," 
and:
"Saltwater crocs - they cop-u-late to pop-u-late!" 
(Sorry, I just made that one up!)
At one point, he actually spoke of "the uncommon tenderness of these giant creatures", and it was then that I - for, yes, it was I - could imagine him getting into the water and 'engaging' with the crocs. The filthy wretch.

News just emerging from the Cambodian city of Battambang this morning, is that an English resident who has been trying for nearly 40 years to solve his Rubik's Cube, has still not done so.
Moys Kenwood, 55, received his Cube as a birthday present way back in 1979, and immediately set about the task of getting the six colors into their correct positions, so that each face of the Cube contained nine squares of the same color.
By Christmas of that year, he had already managed to get the nine red squares all on one face, and was hopeful that the full Cube might be completed soon thereafter.
The years passed. Space Invaders and PacMan came and went. Kenwood studied the Singerman Notation, and struggled on. The Twin Towers shocked the world in 2001, but still the colors refused to align themselves in a way which would satisfy Rubik's Judges. A 7-year period teaching in Thailand followed, during which time Marc Waterman's Algorithm, the Roux Method, and Herbert Kociemba's 'Two-Phase Algorithm' were all employed in ever-more desperate attempts to 'do it', all to no avail.
Finally, even after a move to Cambodia in 2016, the annoying plastic cube grew no less stubborn, and Kenwood finally tossed it into a cardboard box as punishment, in order that it might reconsider its position, and allow itself to be completed. 
Then, whilst looking for something else this morning, the world's least-successful Rubik's Cube exponent opened the box, and saw his nemesis staring at him, 'as bold as brass'. The pair regarded each other. Kenwood had an idea. He decided to 'make a gift of the gift', and gave it to his stepdaughter, Helle. As he handed it over, he smirked to himself, and went to put the kettle on for a cup of tea. That was the last time he'd see that!
Twenty minutes later, however, as he was finishing his brew, his stepdaughter casually walked into the room, talking on her phone, and placed the completed Cube in front of him. He waited until she had gone, then put the Cube back in its prison, never to see the light of day again.

It was unavoidable that sooner our later our exclusive club would be discovered, breached, and gatecrashed by English footy hooligans, desperate for some insanity and hoping looking up Volga Olga's shriveled banana skin skirt! However, these hooligans were slightly different, yes pissed out of their brains, but, non-violent, and bawling their eyes out in disbelief after what they witnessed last night!! So, we let them in and, crafty Jaggedone, emptied their pockets of left-over Rubles in return for buckets of cheap, self-made Russian vodka called, Putin's Coup d 'etat!
Sadly, we had to ban a bunch of non-hooligan, wannabe, intellectual Spoof writer forum participants, excluding Erskin, the real one, because of their utter arrogance and cheap, snide, vocal insults, but who the fuck cares about them?? We do not because our chief Chinese chef, WAN-KIN-DIK, prepared a boiled scorpion, cockroach (not our CIA soldiers, the ISIS version), creepy crawly, non-veggie, soup for them and they puked without laughing!
Never mind, every black cloud (non-racist one) has a sliver-lining and Jaggedone laughed all the way to Limerick to learn about Leprechaun humor at its very best, the non-educated type, which is so much better than those preached by Spoof scientists on the subject!
Adios los locos and English Hooligans, non-violent, all over the planet because our pride nobody can ever take from us!!!

Restaurants called "Red Hen," were at first riding a wave of hate from conservatives protesting the owner of a Red Hen restaurant ordering Trump Press Secretary Sarah Sanders to leave. And not because he was afraid there wasn't enough food in the restaurant to feed her. 
Sanders was asked to leave because of her working for Trump. The restaurant owner knew it would be hard for customers to digest their food while Sarah was there, worrying that Trump might be coming in too.
After liberals found out conservatives were attacking the place, the liberals started coming to the Red Hen for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The conservatives were unable to attack the restaurant any further due to the long lines that now gathered at the restaurant every day. The Huckabee Huckelberrys are a favorite of the clientele.

There was a swift reaction to the news earlier this week that supermarket giants Asda and Sainsbury were to merge, when several other major players also announced their own intentions to join forces.
First to react was Tesco, who revealed that they will go into partnership with Morrisons. Tesco boss John Allen said:
"We're teaming- up with Morrisons, but, if I'm honest, I wish it were Netto." 
Allen went on:
"Netto had always been on our radar. They had an excellent business model, a massive share of the available market, and I'd always loved their plastic bags - the yellow ones with the little black dog on them."
Two other supermarkets that are rumoured to be involved in advanced discussions are the similarly-named Aldi and Lidl. Both German, this partnership is already being called Der Anschluss.
Waitrose, Co-op and Iceland are due to meet on Tuesday to discuss plans for a triumvirate, whatever that is.
In related news, shoe shop Schüh are thought to be in talks with Clarks, and, in Swindon, the rumour mill is working overtime with regard to a takeover of Bert's Paper Shop by J. Brown's Newsagents.
Meanwhile, Costa Coffee have said they wouldn't touch Starbucks with a barge pole.

BILLINGSGATE POST: Finally finding religion after turning tricks for the past seven years, Irena Klavisvoka says that she now regrets peeing on the bed once slept in by Barack and Michelle Obama.
“We were just romping around like school girls, and I started to laugh so hard that I peed my pants. Had nothing to do with dissing the Obamas. I had no idea that they had used this bed for sleeping. To me, that is just plain silly.”
Somewhere, British spy Michael Steele must be smiling. Although his notorious dossier that was used to obtain a FISA warrant on Donald Trump made no mention that Irena was wearing pants at the time of the incident, one can only surmise that they may have come off later in the evening.

Record numbers of movie fans have been packing into cinemas all over the US this weekend to see 'Texas Chain Store Manager', the new blockbuster from Disney.
The movie features mainly unknown actors from the Austin and Dallas areas, but early reviews have been favorable.
The storyline concerns a girl, Lesley, and her paraplegic brother, Wesley, who go to a chain store in Dallas to return a leather bag which is damaged. Their friends, Milly, Molly and Mally, excited about a trip to the city, go along.
A series of disasters befalls the group. First, they pick up a hitchhiker. He tries it on with Milly and Molly, and Mally kills him with a pocketknife, stabbing him 48 times visible to viewers, but dozens of times out-of-picture. They toss his body into a pond, and drive on, whistling.
Almost out of fuel, they stop at a gas station, but the owner tells them that the pumps are empty. They kill him by driving over him in their vehicle, backwards and forwards, over and over again, until his tangled body looks like a large piece of meat. They syphon gas out of his vehicle using his windpipe.
They see a house a couple of miles farther down the road, and raze it to the ground, then drive to the mall. When they get there, the five, with Wesley in his wheelchair, make straight for the bag shop with branches all over the state, The Texas Bag Chain Store. Lesley takes her bag and approaches the counter, but is absolutely horrified when a man who introduces himself as 'The Manager' confronts her with a face that looks like it has been made from leather. She fears she has made a mistake. Anxiously looking round, she sees nothing but power tools, saws, blades and piercing implements. 'Leatherface' explains that they no longer sell bags, and have diversified somewhat, so that they now sell big cutting tools. He apologises for not yet having had time to change the store's signage, then reaches under the counter and brings out a large chain saw, with which he decapitates both Wesley and Milly in one movement. 
Lesley screams at him in the movie's defining moment:
"But I've even brought the receipt, Godammit!" 
Mally is next. Leatherface slices him 'in half' from head to feet, giggling. Molly shrieks in terror, but this is cut short as Leatherface leaps over the counter and rams a power drill up against her temple, and 'lets her have it'. The drill bit can be seen passing behind her eyes as they are forced out of their sockets. 
Lesley and her bag are left facing Leatherface in the movie's final scene, but I won't spoil the ending for you.
The film is rated PG.

There was fun in the air in the Battambang commune of Tapon on Friday afternoon, when motorbike riders staged a 'wheelie demonstration', which pleased the local residents 'no end'.
The teenaged riders converged near the market about 4:30pm, but, having been told by traders to take their stupid antics elsewhere, they giggled amongst themselves and rode off at high speeds, whooping with delight.
Once they were out of sight of the busy market, however, and had found a nice, straight bit of road where they could 'exercise their craft', they started 'pulling wheelies' - a dangerous stunt whereby the rider raises the motorbike into an almost vertical, rather than horizontal, position, by yanking the handlebars upwards, whilst applying plenty of throttle.
That there were a group of young children playing on some grass nearby, seemed of no consequence whatsoever.
The scallywags rode up and down on one wheel near the frightened tots for around three minutes until Englishman Moys Kenwood arrived home from work. Seeing the madness, he shouted wildly at the youths as he passed them on a motorbike being driven by his wife, but this had no effect.
Just then, however, a woman emerged from her house and coolly threw a large bowl of dishwater over one of the riders mid-wheelie, which made him curtail the wheelie rather sooner than he might have done had he not been drenched in filth. His mates cheered, and the show was over.
There was no angry protest by the 'Wheelie Riders', no shouting or screaming, no argument about how insane it had been to try to dislodge the rider from his bike by throwing water over him, no threat by either party to get the police involved, indeed, there was no dialogue of any sort. 
The riders had met their match, and rode off to pull wheelies elsewhere.

An aide of President Donald Trump, (Potus - hippopotamus abbreviated), has mistakenly revealed that his wife, Melania is "in for repairs".
Melania Trump has not appeared in public for 24 days and it has now been announced she will not be accompanying her husband on two key foreign trips.
The unnamed Aide who was sacked 2 days earlier for his "incompetent gaffe" due to Donald Trumps (Potus-his family were Scottish Potters) newfound omnipotustent abilty to see into the future, allegedly stated via email to the IT department that " Melania is in for repairs, she's having a chip added to increase empathy and clothes sense and has a couple of mobility problems in the pistons in her arms affecting hand movement plus the usual "wear and tear down there." 
The IT department replied that they would need to install updated software to ensure "Melania's functions continued smoothly."
The President had previously said that he was completely unaware of his wife's whereabouts and had assumed she was shopping with Kim Kardashian.
The Kardashian family have confirmed that Kim is also "in for repairs" following her recent meeting with President Trump.

IQUITOS (WAHUU VILLAGE): Amazon Chief Tribesman Humba Homba Hombongo today confirmed has submitted his resignation after learning the shocking defeat of Malaysia's Barisan National during the 14th General Election that was held on May 9. The defeat of Malaysia's 60 year ruling party is not just felted across Malaysia only, but all over the world including the uncharted territories on the world map. Wahuu Village is no exception. 
The chief tribesman is waiting for the Supreme Tribesman King Chuckawakooba Mongchuck to accept his resignation and finding a replacement. 
“We need to get the Supreme Tribesman King's approval before we can announce (his successor),” he said, adding that he would meet with the king to immediately “find his successor”.
The Deputy Chief Tribesman Wahu Sumpe Pauchuluuu was speaking to reporters after chairing the weekly tribesmen meeting here.
When asked Hombongo had given any reason for his decision to step down, Pauchuluuu said he had said the following:
“he expressed his desire to resign out of shock of Malaysia's unexpected election result.”
Hombongo had also thanked the tribesman council for being given the “honour and privilege” to serve the village of Wahuu since 2014.

Hoodies, hooligans, and other juvenile reprobates are being deprived of their favorite "adrenaline kick-starter" (in the goolies mostly) because some supermarkets in the UK believe they have too much wasteful energy! 
So, instead of selling under-age hooligans a can of energy drink for breakfast, supermarkets are now reviving an ancient custom by telling them a glass of milk is much healthier!
Hoodies, hooligans and other nasties, told the supermarkets involved in the campaign to, "go and fuck themselves" because milk makes them puke and, a ride on a raging, red, bull, etc, gives them enough energy to complete their daily sporting activities, and here are just a few of them:
1) Kicking the shit out of tramps, homeless people, alcoholics and other wasters...
2) Kicking the shit out of grannies, granddads, and other useless old farts whilst they walk their doggies in UK parks disturbing their dirty business dealings!
3) Terrorising shoppers in shopping centers and running away from bored security guards picking their noses waiting for their shift to end requires much energy! 
4) Olympic discipline Numero uno for kids, 24/7, narcissistic, selfie taking on smartphones without a "bull-ish boost" is impossible!
5) Kicking the shit out of gays, illegal immigrants, and others who do not belong to their moronic society takes a massive amount of energy, and on a 'pussy' glass a milk they might not get the adrenaline rush required to become a champion shit-kicker; who knows?
So, UK supermarkets refusing to sell energy drinks to U16 kids who need an "energy kick" up the butt, please offer them milk or a fruity smoothie instead because going to school on a glass of milk or banana might turn them into respectful human beings and not full of flying bull-shit!

It was the soundtrack to 1981, the backdrop to an entire summer of crazy 'wing-flapping' on the dancefloor, and probably the worst record you ever heard, but the Birdie Song by The Tweets is up for re-release next month.
Originally written in the 1950s by Werner Thomas, an accordion player from Davos in Switzerland, the oom-pah song became popular at drinking festivals, such as Oktoberfest, where the 'chicken dance' was invented. 
It was released on vinyl in Holland in 1980, and then in the UK by The Tweets in 1981, where it 'soared' into the charts at number 2. You could hear it everywhere: the radio, the TV, people humming it in the street, on the bus, at work, in the dole office, betting shop and pub. It even got played in nightclubs, where drunken, fighting hordes temporarily forgot their disputes, and flapped their 'wings' in unison on the dancefloor until they collapsed, threw up, or laid an egg. 
To many people, it became 'a huge, sinister and hideous presence' from which they were unable to escape, an insidious, lingering threat around every corner, and the source of countless sleepless nights when brains refused to forget it, and amplified it to 'crescendo level'. It was The Summer Of Tired Eyelids. In 2000, it was voted 'The Most Annoying Song Of All Time' by dotcom.
Twitter has agreed to sponsor the release, to which there have been no changes at all, allowing music fans to live through the nightmare once more.
Release date: 32nd July.

An Elvis Presley lookalike competition in the pretty East Yorkshire seaside town of Bridlington yesterday, drew contestants from all over the world, none of whom looked like Elvis Presley.
The 'Welcome To Elvis 2018' event is being staged at Bridlington Spa, and is a great draw for tourists, who enjoy taking photographs of, and being photographed with, the 'Presleys' who do not even remotely resemble Elvis.
Not only did these 'Elvis impersonators' not look like Elvis, they did not sound like him either. Feeling like they were obliged to, at least, try sounding like Elvis, the bogus Presleys staged an impromptu singalong with bewildered daytrippers on the seafront promenade. They burst into 'Jailhouse Rock'. Clouds - not crowds - gathered. One member of the audience laughed:
"Who yer supposed to be doin - Shakin' Stevens?"
The watchers, about 8-strong, roared with laughter. The Presleys moved away to seek a new audience. Finding some elderly folks sitting on benches eating ice-creams around some rather lovely beds of yellow and white chrysanthemums, the Kings of Rock stopped and tried again. This time, they went 'low-key' for the oldies, and crooned 'Love Me Tender'.
"Get the fuck owdavit!" shouted a man, about 80, "Fuckin Teddy Boys! We don't want your sort round ere! Piss off to Southend, y'silly bastards!"
Shame-faced, the now-dwindling group of Presleys sloped off again. Rain started to fall. One of their number, wearing a Hawaiian shirt similar to the one his idol wore in 'Blue Hawaii', pulled his shirt over his head to protect his coiffeured quiff, as the gang made its way into Bridlington town center, looking rather bedraggled.
Seeing a group of buskers playing just inside the railway station, one of the Presleys asked if the musicians knew 'Blue Suede Shoes'. They did. It was on! As the Elvis look-not-likes hammered out the opening lines, and the musicians gave it their all, the show was finally on the road! Now they had their audience, their 5 minutes of fame! One woman, clearly impressed, said:
"I always liked a bit of that Roy Orbison!"

Pope Francis has spoken out at the end of a two-day conference in the Vatican, saying that the world must convert to clean fuel, and that climate change was a challenge of "epochal proportions".
But representatives of some of the companies present at the conference, told him to get his own house in order before criticising theirs. 
This didn't go down at all well with the Pope.
Bill Bubbleman of ExxonMobil, in a very clever rewording of the Pope's quote "Civilisation requires energy, but energy use must not destroy civilisation," said:
"Civilisation requires Religion, but Religion must not destroy civilisation."
Bubbleman explained how he thought religion was responsible for most of what was going wrong in the world at the moment, and particularly the different conflicts in so many countries. The Pope asked him for evidence of this, and Bubbleman started to provide it, only to be given a slap in the face by the feisty Pope, who then gave him the two-fingered sign as his supporters cheered. When the oil man tried to respond to this, the Pope pushed him in the chest, then brought his knee up into the groin area of his opponent, doubling him up. With an agility that spoke of martial artistry, the religious leader then took a step backwards and flicked out his right foot into Bubbleman's face. The ExxonMobil man didn't get up from this. He lay in a heap before the Pope, and the crowd cheered again vociferously.
Other companies present at the conference were BP, Royal Dutch Shell, Equinor and Pemex of Mexico, but their representatives said nothing.

BILLINGSGATE POST: While the average American male worker takes a daily shower or bath to refresh himself and also rid himself of pesty parasites, dangling dingle berries and pungent odors that might effect his love life deleteriously, carnival workers are furious that such indignities might be forced on them by the owners of the traveling carnivals that seem to pop up in every small town in America each summer.
Now that Memorial Day showers have been made mandatory as part of a union agreement that was hammered out this Spring, the mere suggestion that workers might have to take another shower before Labor Day has these roughnecks excogitating ways to beat the system and retain their hard earned status as "America's most foul labor force."
Carnival worker's union chief, Sammy "Civet Cat" Costa, said that traditionally, carnival workers have always been allowed to bathe or not bathe at their own discretion. Many carnival workers, including Ferris Wheel operator, Vernon "Vertical Spin" Tortacelli, aren't convinced that the chicks would dig them if they weren't odiforous. Certainly there is scholarship that ranks armpit odor as one of Nature's finest aphrodisiacs, especially if sniffed by banal "Sex in the City" type sophisticates.
Under the old rules, Tortacelli pointed out; "We used to be allowed to bathe in the common tank. I guess it became a problem because this was the same water earmarked for the snow cone machine. I suppose that mandatory mid-summer showers might be okay as long as we don't have to use soap."
HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY!

Breaking: Mr. Kim Jong Un, President of North Korea, is working on ways to help defray expenses of the upcoming summit with US President Donald Trump.
Mr. Kim’s bill at The Fullerton Hotel, “a magnificent neoclassical hotel,” according to The Washington Post, runs a tab of $6,000 a night.
Complexities here include that Mr. Trump cannot pay the bill for Mr. Kim, due to the possibility the North Korean President would feel insulted.
Therefore, Singapore is being asked to foot the bill.
Not the least of his troubles, Mr. Kim has outdated transportation with a jet liner that cannot make the entire trip, due to its age.
These frugalities have come about due to Kim’s pouring all available monies into the nuclear weapons program, now North Korea’s central bargaining chip.
Normally, his own diet is rice and dandelion weeds three days a week. 
However, he does supplement this diet somewhat from a special fund direct to Magnum Doubles Hazlenut ice cream cones.
This contract was cleared by the NSA last year.
Transportation problems may be solved by Mr. Lavrov, of Russia, who runs his own airline taxi service out of Moscow, although Secretary of Defense Mattis disapproves of this idea.
Mr. Lavrov guarantees his fleet of taxis is unarmed and can pick up Mr. Kim from China and whisk him to The Hotel Fullerton and back as a complimentary service to assist the talks.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kim is once again showing the engaging side of his personality.
Additional to more smiling, he has offered to do a nightclub gig in one of The Fullerton Hotel’s nightclubs, titled “Smiling Jane’s Boudoir.”
Mr. Kim is by now well known for his passion as nightclub performer, with original music and lyrics.
His “I’ve got the PNAC hustle blues, baby” number, recently causing great consternation and mystery for the CIA, was finally resolved as reference to America’s “project for a new American century” from the 1990’s.
Intoning “why not a PNKC, baby,” and his plaintive, “why me, why me” chorus have helped US and world intelligence agencies understand his long-range plans more clearly.
In review, his program involves first taking over South Korea, then moving on to seize and occupy the Hawaiian islands, and finally to arrive with formidable force at Malibu Beach.
In short, the old “domino theory” is alive and well in the interior blueprints and strategies of Mr. Kim as he seeks to move his country forward.
Mr. Trump is well aware of these intentions, but has said he will attend Mr. Kim’s performance at Hotel Fullerton, “in the interests of world leadership on this matter.”

Hello, my name is Germaine Greer and some of you may remember me for being at the forefront of something or other called Women's Lib, beginning with my book Spare Rib. I have been called a feminist and a feminazi in my time, but that's water off a duck's back to me and despite my reputation, I can tell you that in my time I have had more than my quota of pork sausage.
I am here today in the presence of three distinguished male guests to whom I will be putting difficult questions on male attitudes. They are His Holiness Pope Francis, sovereign of the Vatican City State, Sir Elton John, well known ivory tinkler, and the Late Peter Stringfellow, night club owner and general sex pest who is ably assisted by clairvoyant conman Derek Acora.
GG. Welcome gentlemen and Mr. Stringfellow. As you know there is a current fashion for young to women shave, I think you know what I mean. How do you feel about that?
Pope Francis: In the interest of the church's new policy of equality I cannot fault it. But in the not so recent past I would have burned a bearded woman at the stake as a witch.Peter Stringfellow / Derek Acora: Hold on, I'm just getting Peter coming through. What's that, Peter? Okay, got it. Peter says It makes sense as it stops me getting hairs stuck in my teeth or it used to before I kicked the bucket.Sir Elton John: I prefer a little bit of fuzz around the relevant bits whether male or female, but nicely trimmed of course to keep them neat and tidy, and it shows maturity. 
GG: Thank you. Women's fertility has long been a battle for control between the sexes. Do you think it's right for fusty old men in smoke filled rooms to decide whether or not a woman should have access to contraception or abortion?
Pope Francis: Absolutely not and I don't smoke. It's only right that a life long celibate like me should give pastoral comfort and sexual advice to young women, otherwise how would they cope with married life?Sir Elton John: Well, my experience of women's fertility is limited to my surrogate mothers, so it's hard for me to comment. They didn't mind David and me using the old turkey baster on them and it was quite fun to see their reaction when I told them they were now full of a mixture of spunk from both David and me. Two for the price of one. Job done. Peter Stringfellow / Derek Acora: Peter's laughing now at what you said, Elton. Just a minute. He says he's very grateful for the contraceptive pill or he would have spent his fortune on johnnies and paternity payments. 
GG: I'm not sure those were appropriate comments. So what do you think if a woman wears crotchless panties?
Peter Stringfellow / Derek Acora: Peter says it shows she's up for it and he would be too, if he wasn't dead. It turns him on.Pope Francis: Forgive me, but I am not familiar with this item of clothing. Don't their testicles fall through?Sir Elton John: Kiki Dee used to wear them and took delight in showing me. That's why I always called her "Kinky" Kiki. It was actually a vain attempt to seduce me but she realises now that I enjoy wearing them.
GG: Interesting, Sir Elton. Are women objectified sexually?
Pope Francis: Not in my case. I treat women with the utmost respect and sometimes I test my vow of abstinence by having Sisters Promiscuous and Fellatio share my bath. They graciously wash me, singing hymns and praying for my blessing. I often ejaculate as they do so, but that is Satan's work and no pleasure is involved at all for me, thank God.Peter Stringfellow / Derek Acora: Peter often said - I am a feminist at heart and if a woman wants to sell her body, to me in particular, then that is her business and in no way does it mean that I am objectifying her. She is just a good shag to me. He's asking now if that will do as an answer.Sir Elton John: I suppose they are, but I'm not really bothered about it.

A man travelling back to his home in Battambang on a motorcycle being ridden by his wife, experienced a strange phenomenon this afternoon, when he noticed that, although one side of the road was wet and had puddles, the opposite side was bone dry!
No stranger to freakish weather conditions, Moys Kenwood, 54, remarked to his wife about the odd sight, and the pair discussed how it seemed as though the road itself had acted as some sort of 'dividing line' for the rain that had obviously been falling in the area.
Mrs Kenwood said that it was "mere coincidence" that the rain had stopped where it had, and that 'rain wasn't aware of any man-made geographical barriers which governed where it fell'.
Her husband disputed this. He told her about an occasion when he was once cycling home in a rainstorm, travelling from east to west along Garrison Road in Hull, and crossed the Myton Bridge over the River Hull which divides the city. Soaked to the skin, he rode down the bridge's west side to discover that, here, there had been no rain, and west Hull was bathed in sunshine! He asked her what she thought of that, but she just smiled and shook her head, as if she had just had to sit through some 'playground tale' recounted by a slightly-retarded 5-year-old. She said:
"The rain has to stop somewhere, so, once in a while, it might be that the edge of the cloudline just happens to be aligned with something at ground level. There's nothing magical about it, you simpleton!"
Slightly offended at being spoken to like an imbecile, Mr Kenwood sat in silence for the rest of the journey, wishing he could prove her wrong.

Scientist at the Glowing Fellow Nuclear Research and Development Center (GFNRDC) in Boulder, Colorado have discovered the God Particle can cure someone of kleptomania. The discovery was made when kleptomaniac, Joey Fingers, went to nuke a burrito in the centrifuge where they were centrifuging the God Particle. His hand absorbed a number of God Particles which caused an end to his kleptomania. 
Joey Fingers is an employee at the research center who previously stole just about everything that was not nailed down.
“He even stole my underwear with my pants still on”, lamented scientist Billy Blush. “He stole practically everything in sight. We had to stop doing experiments for a few weeks because he stole the lab’s cyclometer. He did give it back to us though”. 
“Joey was pretty bad”, chipped in scientist Larry Loco. “He is like a turd rolling down a hill collecting dirt. He will steal anything. We couldn’t fire him because he is protected by the Fox-Spears Kleptomaniac act. We have to keep an eye on everything even if you have something in your possession as he can still manage to steal it. We had one scientist get her false teeth stolen while she was wearing them”.
“I was really bad there until I nuked the burrito in the centrifuge”, said Joey Fingers. “I’m kind of glad I did because now the restrooms will have toilet paper in them and everyone will be able to eat their lunch. My apartment is so full of stolen stuff I hardly have any room to walk around in. I’m in the process of returning everything to its rightful owner, if I can remember who the rightful owner is of so much of the stolen stuff”.
The Center for Mental Health Control (CMHC) has been trying to partner with GFNRDC in order to cure more people of Kleptomania but GFNRDC has refused due to the top secret nature of their work.
As of press time it has been discovered that while the God Particle cures Kleptomania it has a side effect which turns the kleptomaniac into an axe murderer.

The owner of a satirical news website has revealed that he is to experiment with a new 'block' feature so that both writers and readers will have the option to avoid reading anything written by a writer whose material does not meet with their approval.
Chad Nackers, editor at The Onion, said that, even though the site is at the forefront of satirical nonsense news, not every one of its writers is loved by every one of its readers. Or its writers, for that matter. Nackers:
"We all have our own favorites, and, of course, there are those we just, plain and simple, don't like. I thought I'd offer readers the option, as Facebook does, to avoid contributors they don't much care for so that they never have to read their shit submissions. It's a trial; we'll see how it goes."
The idea already has already generated opinion, both for and against.
One writer told me:
"Great idea! I have my own preferred contributors, but there are also those I might try to avoid reading. One writer, in particular, immediately springs to mind - a real tide-mark of scum in the literary bath."
Another said:
"I'll definitely be using this feature. Some of the shit I have to wade through is excruciatingly bad, poorly thought-out, incoherent, imbecilic and infantile."
But there was also opposition. A writer who I cannot name said: 
"No, give me randomness! Haha! That's how my stories usually get viewed, anyway - lots of accidental hits from Google!! (And why not, fellow spoofers?!?!) I realise I'm not everybody's cup of char (who is?!) but I make a lot of people laugh. Haha! Even if I have to crawl round all my social media friends to view and rate my stories. GET IT?"
Other satirical news websites have remained tight-lipped about their plans to offer the 'block' option.

Aging crooner, Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner CBE - collectively known as 'Sting' - has been stung by a wasp in his back garden.
The former policeman from Wallsend who now owns a huge estate in Wiltshire, was shovelling some manure onto a rosebed on Thursday afternoon, when the striped fiend approached him from behind, and gave him 'what for' on his bottom. Sting stood up straight with a start.
But it didn't end there.
Sumner CBE it was, who was almost-single-handedly responsible for the repeatedly-repetitive lyrics in many of the songs released by the Police, and the wasp seemed to be aware of this fact.
Targeting the gardener's rear, it stung Sting stingingly, stunning Sting stiff, causing him to stutter:
"De do do do, De da da da, ouch, y'fucking bastard!"
After rubbing the affected area of skin for several minutes, and looking around in vain, Sting went back to his roses. The wasp readied itself. Suddenly, Sting changed his tune:
"I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing, I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing, I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing, I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing, I can't, I can't, I can't stand losing..." 
The wasp stung Sting's stomach, and the former frontman folded in agony. He tried to sit down on a bench, but his bottom was throbbing like the bassline on 'The Bed's Too Big Without You', and he slowly returned to the rosebed, wondering where his wife Trudie was.
"So lonely! So lonely! So lonely! I feel so lonely! So lonely! So lonely! So lonely! I feel so lonely! So lonely! So lonely! So lonely! I feel so lonely!So lonely! So lonely! So lonely! I feel so lonely!So lonely! So lonely! So lonely! I feel so lonely!So lonely! So lonely! So lonely! I feel so lonely!..."
In came the wasp. Again, the stinging stinger stung Sting the singer. 
"Y'fucking bastard!" yelled Sting, adding "I'll fucking kill you!"
Trudie had crept up.
"Who are you talking to?"
Sting waved her question away, and starting shovelling shit once more. Trudie sidled up to her husband and leaned against him. He stopped digging, and looked lovingly at his wife. Suddenly Sting sang:
"Don't stand so, don't stand so, don't stand so close to me!Don't stand so, don't stand so, don't stand so close to me!Don't stand so, don't stand so, don't stand so close to me!
whilst Trudie rhythmically repeated:
"Please-don't-stand-so-close-to-me!Please-don't-stand-so-close-to-me!Please-don't-stand-so-close-to-me!"
The wasp knew it was beaten. Without a second thought, it went airborne, and left the King of Pain and his barmy wife in the manure, endlessly repeating mundane lyrics.

The Stanley Cup-winning Washington Capitals is the first Washington, D.C. sports team to win a major sporting event since the Washington Senators won the World Series in 1924. 
Most of the team, however, have decided that it would take too long to drive to the White House, even though the team practices not far from there.
"I would have to make three left turns to get there and that's unlucky" said one player.
"My wife's car will be blocking my car in the driveway that afternoon and we always get in a fight when I want her to move it" alibied another player.
"I really don't know where the White House is and I hear they have really bad traffic" said the only other player willing to comment.

An alarm clock owner in the Cambodian second-city of Battambang has told of how he awoke late this morning, after his normally-reliable alarm clock failed to wake him up at the normal agreed time.
Moys Kenwood, 55, sets his gray-colored Tesco alarm clock to wake him at 5:30am every weekday morning, but that did not happen today. When he finally awoke from his slumbers 'under his own steam' - at around 5:43 - he noticed that the clock had stopped with the hour hand halfway between the 1 and the 2, and the minute hand 40% of the distance between the 6 and the 7, at 01:32 - for no apparent reason!
Swearing under his breath, Kenwood, turned the clock this-way-and-that in his hands to try to discover why it had malfunctioned, then ripped the back off to check the battery situation: there was one. After shaking the clock, it started to work once more, leaving Kenwood totally nonplussed as to why it had arrested itself at such an unsociable hour in the first place!.
"All avenues of enquiry were exhausted," he said, "and the reason behind the stoppage could not be ascertained. It's a mystery."
Kenwood still arrived at work on time, however, and disciplinary measures were not deemed necessary.

A teacher at a school in Battambang recoiled in horror this afternoon, when a boy in his classroom picked a huge bogey from his nose, and ate it!
There's really not much more to it than that, but, if you force me to expand on it, I will.
The boy, aged about 5, was sitting at the back of the room, in the right-hand corner during a Phonics class which started at 3:30pm this afternoon. Just like the teacher, he was visibly tired, and was daydreaming, probably about what he was going to do when he got out of this tedious, onerous and pointless Phonics class, and was allowed to go home. 
The possibilities were endless. He could play football with his friends, ride his bicycle, climb trees, chase the chickens and ducklings in his yard, throw stones at cows or passing motorcyclists, destroy an ants' nest by setting it alight, or go bathing in the muddy, brown waters of the river that ran behind the back of his house.
The student was having similar thoughts.
Suddenly, and without warning, the student thrust his left index finger into his nasal cavity, rotated it 90°, and then removed it, revealing a long, straggly, olive-colored piece of matter which hung from under his nail. With a vacant look in his eyes, he gently placed the 'thing' on his lips, from where his tongue dragged it into his mouth, lizard-like.
Time stood still. The other students regarded the frozen aspect of the teacher's gaze. He had been the only one in the room to have seen what had just happened, and his brain was still processing the information. Suddenly, the school bell rang; the torment, the pain, the lesson was over. The Boy Who Ate A Bogey put on his schoolbag, and ran to the door with his pals, probably still chewing the 'thing' that he should not have been chewing, and disappeared into the corridor.
Police are not investigating.

A woman who insists that she is right all the time has been proved wrong. Kind of.
The woman, Lesley Jhonson, was once told that she should spell her name 'Johnson', but wouldn't budge, even though her family, as far back as the Domesday Book, has spelt it with the 'J' followed by the 'o'.
Lesley has been right all her life, and, at three months old, was already correcting her mum with an admonishing finger from her crib. Once she had acquired the power of speech, there was no stopping her.
Nobody was spared. Her friends, teachers at school, the school crossing patrol lady, the kind old gentleman at the sweet shop, even her dear old grandma came to feel the powerful force of Lesley, telling them they were wrong, and she was right.
Then, her Judgment Day finally arrived.
Lesley, a prosecuting attorney in Berkeley, CA, was in court, when the defense attorney in the case spoke to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, and told them his client was:
"Innocent until proven guilty."
Lesley's cheeks puffed red, as she objected:
"Objection! The prosecution objects to the use of the word 'proven' where 'proved' is clearly the correct term!"
An argument ensued. The defense said that either word was acceptable, whereas Lesley said that, as 'proved' was the only word used as a Past Tense form of the verb 'prove', it was correct, and 'proven' a corruption of the legitimate form. It was interesting, to say the least. 
The judge, bewildered, watched the exchanges like a spectator at a tennis match, but stayed silent. The defense attorney looked amazed that Lesley was sticking to her guns so rigidly over something which seemed so unimportant, but their paths clearly hadn't crossed before.
Lesley rolled her sleeves up and got busy. She cited the 19th century grammarians Joseph Hull, Seth Hurd, Richard Bache and Luther Townsend, who, for various reasons, poured scorn on the word 'proven'. She mentioned William Hills, Frank Vizetelly and Sherwin Cody, who said similar things in the 20th century, and only 'rested her case' when she could see the eyes of one of the members of the jury start to glaze over. Surely, the case had been proved, hadn't it?
Not quite. The defense, no slouch, licked his lips, and rose slowly. First of all, he told the court, he personally believed that either of the disputed words could be used. He chose to use 'proven', but would never take issue with anyone who used 'proved'. He cited his own historical evidence in one Thomas Lounsbury, and stated that 'proven' is the more common form when used as an adjective before the noun it modifies. He also asked the jury to remind themselves of its widespread use in Congress. He then directed them to remember Lesley's use of Cody and Vizetelly as 'evidence' to prove that 'proven' was not proper. They remembered. Next, he told them that Cody had called its use 'antiquated' whilst Vizetelly had said it was 'modern', and this within a few years of each other!
"Furthermore," he went on, "Vizetelly asserted that the only place 'proven' could be used correctly was - ironically - in courts of law."
The courtroom fell awkwardly silent. The color drained away from Lesley's previously-puffed cheeks. All eyes watched her sag into her seat. The judge smashed his gavel down thrice and called for "Order! Order! Order!" despite the lack of disorder. Then he spoke:
"I have listened, thoroughly bored, to this discussion, and conclude that either of these usages shall suffice in this courtroom."
Lesley Jhonson leapt out of her chair:
"Objection, your Honor, both to your pronunciation of the word 'either', and to your use of the word 'shall'!"

There were concerns for the future of an ancient Scottish hotel, as well as for the safety of its staff this morning, when it was revealed that guests there had staged a violent protest after having eaten the establishment's special hotel-made soup, which, they claimed, had been ruined by the fact that too many people had been involved in making it.
The beautiful, 500-year-old Cruikshank Hotel in Lanarkshire, prides itself on its Scotch Broth, and is widely-renowned for it, but insiders say that the presence and 'assistance' of a host of trainee cooks from a local catering college resulted in it looking like "a watery paste".
The poor serving did not go down well with the discerning diners, and several of their unruly number invaded the kitchen to register their dissatisfaction.
One stomachwitness told me:
"I pay good money to come here, but tonight was like a visit to a local Soup Kitchen."
Another raged:
"This hotel is part of Scottish folklore, but what happened here just now is best forgotten! It was a classic case of the old adage, you know, the one about the soup being got ready by a greater number of people than was absolutely necessary."
Manager at the Cruikshank, burly George Watt, was just as angry. He said:
"We're aware there was a problem with the Broth. Something like this is not good for business. It won't happen again. Not on my watch!"

DIZNEE'Z LAND, CALIFORNICATE—Mickey Mouse has put Diznee'z Land off limits to paying customers. From now on, the mouse decreed, he will allow “guests” to visit only some parks on some days. “Which ones and when depends on my mood,” the rodent explained.
Mouse's policy applies only to annual passholders, who pay considerably more than guests du joir. Affected visitors have not taken kindly to the change in park procedures.
“It doesn't make any sense to restrict us annual passholders when we're paying over $1,000 per family member for the 'privilege' of bringing our families to Diznee'z Land,” said Daffy Duck (who is not an employee of the amusement park and is not related to either Donald or Daisy Duck, Scrooge McDuck, or the ducklings Huey, Louie, and Dewey). “Day trippers pay only about $90. I know, because I used to be one.”
“It's all about crowd control,” Minnie Mouse, Mickey's gun moll, said, contradicting her bitter half's explanation as to why Duck and other annual passholders won't be able to pass through the turnstiles to several parks. “It's not just a whim; we've given a great deal of thought.”
Asked why the park couldn't sell tickets a week ahead of guests' visits, cutting off sales when the optimum number was reached, rather than shutting out passholders, Minnie confessed, “We never thought of that.”
Currently, Mouse said, “Annual passholders may visit Diznee Californicate Adventure on alternate Tuesdays that occur during a full moon and may visit Downtown Diznee on federal holidays and Gay Days, unless the latter falls on one of the former, in which case guests have to wait until the spring equinox to visit the park.
Parks in other countries, such as Paris and Hong Kong, are open only to Chinese and French passholders, respectively, "provided they wear rose-colored glasses and spats,” Mouse said.
In addition, to “adjust admission to inflation,” the prices of all passes will increase “without notice, as necessary or desirable.”
Asked what he thought about Diznee'z new policies, Duck sang a line from a song that played on the 1950s television show, The Mickey Mouse Klub, albeit with a slight change to the original lyrics: “Now it's time to say goodbye to this greedy com-pan-neee.”
His date, Daisy, said, “Mickey Mouse is a rat!”

Mir-A-Lago, FL President Trump tweeted today that America's scientists are way behind where they should be.
"Why haven't our scientists invented something like Ant-Man's little cars or an Iron Man suit like in the movies? I think, as President, I should be given some kind of super-armor with x-ray and heat vision and other perks," whined Trump. "And how about that super-serum? Captain America had that way back in World War II, which I think came after World War I. Why are we so far behind?" continued Trump
"We have been working on some treatments that would help people with low intelligence and also for folks that suffer from narcissism. And for someone like Trump who is completely in his own world, we have some great new remedies that we think would do him a lot more good than an Iron Man suit" spoke a representative scientist.

In the latest of a series of bizarre, unlikely, and, quite frankly, barely-believable occurences in the Battambang commune of Tapon, a wheel has fallen off a tractor, injuring nobody but itself.
The tractor, once yellow but now mostly rust-colored, was being driven along the road to Battambang early this morning by a local farmer who clearly hadn't heard of 'vehicle maintenance'.
The left rear wheel - one of the big ones - suddenly broke away from its axle about 30 yards from a school, leaving the tractor leaning precariously across the road, as if it were lying in wait for a passing schoolchild to eat.
Panic broke out. The farmer looked around to see what the problem was, then grinned at a motorcyclist who was also grinning, having narrowly avoided being flattened by the escaped wheel. Children going into school screamed - in glee - they'd not seen anything quite like this since the last time it happened, in March. A dog barked - once.
The farmer finished smoking his cigarette, then carefully climbed down from his cab and took a closer look at the busted wheel, which lay still, in silent agony, about 20 feet behind the stricken tractor. 
After this inspection, he fetched two small branches (with leaves) from the side of the road, and placed one behind the vehicle, and one in front of it, to 'warn' other road users of its huge presence. It's thought that, without this pertinent warning, other drivers and motorcyclists may well have plowed straight into the tractor, with horrifying results.
This done, he spoke to a man in a group of people that had come to look at the fun, and that man got on a motorbike and left the scene, grinning as he went. The farmer lit a cigarette, and sat down on the low wall that surrounds the school to wait for help, or the end of time, whichever came first.

Ratings firms are amazed at the records being set by the Scamatology Network, which launched in March. 
"It has the absolute lowest ratings we have ever seen," said a ratings executive. "It is the only network we have seen that, the majority of the time it's on the air, absolutely no one is actually watching."
Another executive chimed in with, "We conducted experiments on the content of the Scamatology Network to see why even really bad infomercials recieved higher ratings. We found that the average person is unable to watch five minutes without either having a sudden urgent need to change the channel, or falling asleep."
"Even though the Scamatology channel is available on YouTube, Roku, DirectTV, Apple devices, and more, no one seems willing to go to the channel more than once, if at all," said the spokersperson.

There was trouble with a capital 'T' in Tapon this morning when it was discovered that a bicycle belonging to the daughter of a writer at satirical news website TheSpoof.com had been stolen.
Delma Kenwood, 3, daughter of Moys Kenwood, loved that fucking bike, a red one with stabilisers, and the callous thieves who crept up to the house last night would do well to ensure that I don't find out their identities, because, without too many questions being asked, their hands could be removed at the wrist, or a hole could be dug for them somewhere remote, and people persuaded to 'look the other way' for not much more than the price of a new bike.
Neighbors sympathised with the victim. One said:
"Never mind, love. Your daddy will buy you a nice, new bike."
Kenwood flashed this neighbor an angry look, but, seeing his daughter's face light up, he said:
"Yes, yes, come on now, my little treasure. We mustn't let these callous bastards, I mean, misters, get us down, must we?. Let's go to the bike shop, and get you a nice, new bike."
A local woman with slack jaws, who had heard about the theft, decided to stop by and offer the benefit of her experience:
"The bastards! I'd have them flogged, though flogging's too good for 'em. I'd tie 'em to the back of a motorbike, and ride all the way to Phnom Penh. That'd give 'em a few scrapes! Or I'd handcuff 'em and put their knackers in a vice, and tighten it one turn every hour - or maybe every day! - until those little balls popped out! Or I'd feed them to tigers! Or crocodiles! Or man-eating ants, Or..." as she wandered off into the distance.
Another neighbor, an old woman of about 80, said:
"It's a sign o' the times. You wouldn't have got that in the old days. Folks was different then. You could leave your back door unlocked. Open, even."
Later, when Delma had brought her nice, new bike home - a violet one with stabilisers, a plastic basket, a bell, and colored spokes - she rode around in circles as happy as a pig in shit, singing softly to herself without a care in the world.
Meanwhile, inside the house, Mr Kenwood sharpened a huge knife.

After the historic first ever man-to-man meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, in Singapore yesterday, Mr Trump had to request a visit from a local doctor last night after complaining of severe discomfort in his right hand.
The pain is thought to have been caused as Mr Kim clenched Trump's hand rather too tightly in what the North Koreans said was "overzealous enthusiasm", but what the President termed "a declaration of War".
Five minutes later, Trump had toned this down a little, and now told reporters:
"I expect that's how they shake hands in that stupid shithole."
Trump confided to one of his aides, that Mr Kim had gripped his hand "as if he were gripping his weener", and had squeezed it relentlessly until Mr Trump started to feel faint. Only when Mr Kim had felt that he had 'the upper hand' did he relinquish his tight grip.
The North Korean party were extremely pleased with how things worked out, and have released a news statement in Pyongyang claiming that Mr Kim now has the US "in the palm of his hand".
The doctor was later able to give Mr Trump's hand the all-clear.

Tel Aviv IL: Pharmer Pharmaceuticals is drawing criticism over an alleged breakthrough psychiatric drug which is touted as a first in it's class. There are currently 3 groups of medications used for epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Among them are: neuroleptics, sedatives, and anticonvulsants. 
Enter Pulumbra. On the face it seems to be a cure all. Bratty kid? Pulumbra! Perimenopause got you stressted? Pulumbra! Does your husband have an overcharged libido? Pulumbra! Teen not paying attention in school, acting out, or looking at porn? Pulumbra! Ever get into a "good mood" only to find you aren't in one at the moment? That's bipolar axis II baby- and what do we say? Pulumbra! 
So what exactly is Pulumbra? According to Pharmer spokeswoman Nomi Abaddon the active ingredient is plumbic acetate. In layman's terms it's lead. Yes lead. The stuff which may have attributed to the Roman empire's slow decline into darkness.
Psychopharmacologist Horton Hall of the CDC just chuckled and said, "Well, to play devil's advocate, if you look at what lead poising does in it's totality many of the behavioral symptoms are on par with anti-psychotic drugs. Even the side effects of current meds. Actually anti-psychotics have a few more side effects, for example lead poisoning isn't really known for hair loss or male breast enlargement with galactorrhea. I'm almost starting to think this could be a safer alternative- I'm kidding of course." 
According to Ms. Abaddon, "The medication is a more natural alternative to synthetic chemicals. Poison, medicine it's all about dosing. We use radiation to treat cancer all the time but I wouldn't advise carrying plutonium around in your pocket for good luck. This attack on our drug is generated by Russian influence through fake news. It's a problem we suffer with just as the United States does. It's really more about attacking Israel and any country with free democratic ideals than issues of health care." 
As I reflected on this conversation I found some silver lining. Perhaps Flint Michigan can turn their water contamination crisis into a real money machine! Seriously, just think of it..... Flint Miracle Elixir: Bottled at the Source USA. I believe it would work too- just so long as they offer a carbonated lemon/lime version.

HARFOLD, Vt. - We've all been "hangry," that grumpy disposition when we get home late and haven't had a meal. God forbid you've missed an entire meal.
But the female cafeteria staff at Harfold State College in Harfold, Vermont, have determined that there's one thing that can majorly escalate feelings of hangry in their spouses: 
Combine a missed meal with the fact that you haven't brought him his goddamn beer and you've pretty much asked for an evening of pure shit hitting the fan.
Said Gayle Dubé, salad prep specialist, "If my Daryl has plopped his ass in his chair and actually sits there longer than three minutes without his Papst Blue Ribbon, am I ever gonna hear about it!
"One night he wouldn't shut up about it, so I got him another beer--with two crushed up sleeping pills stirred in for fun. If my Daryl didn't pass out within 20 minutes and promptly pee himself!"

Secret service bailiffs are poised to evict Meghan Markle from her Kensington Palace safe-house after the ageing American gold digger failed a security background check.
Hunkered down in one of the country’s top taxpayer-bankrolled grace-and-favor boltholes Markle, 69, has been bullish about an upcoming life of full-blown graft following her engagement to top UK con artist ‘Prince Harry’.
Now all that meticulously-planned public purse leeching looks set to bomb following a top secret security sweep nailing the bloodsucker as a cheap Obamanation fraud.
“We think bent former US Attorney General Eric Holder crafted Meghan’s entire background profile,” a British government deep throat told SatireWorld reporters.
“A lot cheaper than recruiting another indigenous fruitcake like Princess Diana,” the former spymaster added, “but just as fucking insane.”

New York City, New York – (SatireWorld.com)  
Two hundredweight of Botox impounded at a Saudi camel beauty pageant was redirected to Clinton Foundation orifices this morning ahead of its upcoming annual Valentines Day bash.
Cases of the noxious nerve-freezer toxin marked ‘For The Personal Attention Of Mrs H Clinton’ had been impounded by Riyadh authorities amid suspicions of unprecedented new chicanery levels of at this year’s Bactrian Beauty awards.
The competition offers ten top prizes of one million dollars awarded by judges looking for character as well as exceptional camel beauty.
Including much-prized natural features like ‘springy nasal bristles’ top-rated by the public for their steel hawser-like charms.
Commenting on the latest pageant controversy a Ms Beautiful Saudi Arabian Camel 2018 committee member was sanguine amid reporters’ questions about redirecting the Botox to Mrs Clinton:
“It started when we found suspicious camel butt implants,” pageant organiser Kamel Al Boosh told SatireWorld reporters, “followed by silicone-enhanced udders and other non-Halal stuff.”
SatireWorld readers may remember how the failed US 2016 presidential candidate once posed naked at an earlier Ms Beautiful Camel competition for a chance to win her party’s coveted presidential nomination.
“Alas she’s since put on at least 100lbs of wobbly arselard,” Mr Al Boosh commented, “AND lost her party’s billions in failed 2016 campaigning.”

Key leaders in the Democratic Party are calling for the ban of Romaine Lettuce (now called assault lettuce).  According to figures from the CDC (Center for Disease Control), there have now been more than 150 reported cases of food borne illness reported in over 30 states due to Assault Lettuce.  There have already been deaths.
Hillary Clinton has called the criminalization of possession of Romaine lettuce and the registration and monitoring of all other forms of lettuce (including iceberg, kale, endive, red leaf, green leaf, and spinach).  
“People cannot be given free and unlimited access to these dangerous food substances.  We need lettuce control and we need it now!  We cannot depend upon responsible lettuce purchases, as not all people who use lettuce are responsible.”
Congresswoman Maxine Waters said “ain’t no nothing ’bout no lettuce in da Constitution, I thinks.”  This publication is unable to quote the rest of her statement, as it was about as incomprehensible as everything else that she says.
When asked if lettuce eating was permitted by the Constitution, Nancy Pelosi stated that we would have to read it to find out.
The National Lettuce Association (NLA), a major lobbyist and proponent for freedom of lettuce (and all other greens) is opposed to any forms or romaine (or any other lettuce) registration or control. 
According to Bert Henry, a NLA lobbyist in Washington, DC, “We cannot impose restrictions like lettuce rationing, waiting periods, nor background checks. People need their salad and sandwiches when they want them! Believe me. They want them fresh. What are we to do, serve wilted greens like the French?”
Strangely enough, Democrats have not called for regulation of Arugula, saying that this foreign lettuce must be allowed to retain civil rights and that registration of arugula would be both discriminatory and profiling.
Many in the current administration believe illegal Arugula will be flooding the borders to take advantage of the price spikes due to the ban on Romaine. 
Congressional leader Nancy Pelosi has suggested replacing lettuce subsidies with a promotion of alternative leafy fare by suggesting increased Congressional support for spinach. 
According to Capitol Hill insiders, the Pelosi family in California owns several agricultural business that grow 45% of the nation’s spinach crop.

A Judge has denied a petition seeking to free three elephants from the Commerford Zoo located in Goshen, rejecting the argument that the animals should be granted legal person-hood.
The “Nonhuman Rights Project” filed a lawsuit, with the hopes of garnering a writ of habeas corpus for three elephants from the Commerford Zoo. The Florida-based group contended that, considering their cognitive abilities and sense of self, these animals should be considered autonomous beings and thus legal persons who cannot be unlawfully imprisoned.
Americans, not just Connecticut residents, should consider the judge’s ruling a reprieve from a possible plethora of preposterous, pachyderm, federal government proclamations driven by People for the Ethical Treatment of animals (PETA) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). For example:
The Republican controlled 115th Congress would have had to enact new sets of laws, but for the very savvy judge’s ruling. However, it is rumored in Washington DC that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) were working on a joint bill to grant legal personhood to donkeys, just in case!

Cairo police were tagged as racist and quick-on-the-gun after a hastily formed riot squad descended upon a gathering of Congresswoman Maxine Waters supporters assembling in a local park.
Dubbed a protest in support of Citizens Against Common Sense, supporters gathered in Penalty Park where a bronze statue of Maxine Waters on a white horse was about to be unveiled to the awaiting crowd. Crowd estimates were put at over 100 by park rangers.
The Cairo police force, on alert for a Zombie invasion issued by the CDC in 2011, mistook the glazed eyes and blank expressions on the supporters as ‘zombie-like,’ says Cairo Tribune &amp; Gazette reporter Mark Henry. 
According to Henry, "Captain Henry Scwantz gave the order for his officers to 'shoot first and ask questions later.' After two volleys of gunfire and pepper gas, the mayor who was officiating at the event, Donald Flith(D), yelled for a cease fire. The mayor was later photographed by the Gazzette washing pepper spray from his eyes.
Luckily for the supporters, the Cairo police department members are reputed to be terrible shots and the only damage was to the statue which sustained three bullets to the buttocks of Water’s horse, a street lamp globe that was shattered, and a little old lady's dog named Butch.
Butch was taken to Shadyside Cemetary where he was interned with full Democratic Party honors. Butch's master Edna Rosetta, claims she will sue.

San Antonio, Texas   –  (SatireWorld.com)
For years the much anticipated Wedding Night consummation was on the minds of the Pissgum twins Percival and Buck and the Hilton twins, Daisy and Violet. Careful planning for modesty and romance became a delicate balance as just one of the two sets of conjoined twins planned to marry one each other.
The Pissgums, Percival and Buck, have shared everything for all their lives. Adventures around the world as pirates. A brief stint in the Old American West as cowboy outlaws. Even a career as circus performers left the boys closer than the proverbial Siamese Twins. In fact, they were Siamese Twins conjoined at the hip.
So when Buck met Daisy Hilton, another conjoined twin,  Percival felt a little left out since he couldn't get to first base with Daisy’s conjoined sister, Violet. In the worst of the worst of any bad luck, Violet Hilton was a very frustrated lesbian leaving a bewildered Percival out in the cold.
As events progressed on, Buck and Daisy planned their wedding day down to the color of table napkins, and the music the band would perform for the 100 or so invited guests. One last detail remained…How to arrange the wedding night.
Daisy purchased her sexy wedding negligee, a see-through pink affair with easy to open strings and matching panties that hid the thick portion of her conjoined behind.
The hotel room was spacious with a four-poster bed that could accommodate all four with room to spare. Buck and a perturbed Percival showered and scented themselves with expensive cologne. Buck wore a clean set of underwear. Daisy and Violet did the same. Now, the moment of truth was at hand.
The lights dimmed and soft music played on the room's speakers. The soft rustle of crisp satin sheets and the muffled groan of bed springs were the only other sounds as the foursome entered awkwardly onto the wedding night bed.
Buck reached into his pajama top pocket and pulled out a soft package and handed it to Percival.
"What is this? I ain't puttin' da rubber on fer ya!" Percival's face showed indignation.
"It's a mask you idiot. I don't want yer squirrelly fruit-loop eyes checking out my darlin’ bride during such a delicate time!" Buck then smiled and  planted a big wet kiss on Daisy’s cheek.
Daisy smiled while reached over to the table. She handed her sister a paper bag.
"I ain't putting that over my head if that's what you mean!" Violet crossed her arms and scowled at her sister who innocently held the bag.
"No! It's checkers and a checker board so you and Percival have something to do while we have our fun."
In a moment of frenzied, tangling movements Buck positioned himself atop a moaning Daisy. All that Percival could see from a slit under the mask was the head and one arm of Violet from beneath Daisy, as the lusting bride gave herself willingly to her new husband. 
Violet’s one free hand moved the playing pieces across the board as both tried to concentrate on the game at hand, oblivious as they could be to shouts of 'Oh Daddy!' and the repetitive squeaking of tortured bed springs.
Percival glanced over and a thought ran through his mind and a sly smile broke…." King me!"

Broward County, Fl –  (satireworld.com)
Leftist teenage activist David Hogg, who supports everything anti-conservative, publicly revealed today that four out of four colleges he applied to this past winter have turned him down for this fall starting semester citing various reasons.
The first university to reject Hogg was Swampwater University in Cornpone Acres, Alabama. The private university cited a ‘cancelled class’ for the subject he hoped to major in. 
“We had to let Mr. Hogg know that the Saul Alinsky class for advanced communist and revolutionary studies was canceled way back in 1951,” said university dean Melville Jones.
Number two to put the brakes on Hogg’s ambitions was his hometown Broward Community College which said his SAT score was ‘way too low’ citing his application that listed his score as being ‘below 175’.
Number three was Thurber University in Hog Jaw, Arkansas which claimed he ‘couldn’t fit in with current applicants.’
The final college Hogg applied to was an offshore school in Senagal, West Africa that based their decline on his skin color which was applicable to his course choice…White Privilege.
A spokesperson from CNN who also replies to questions directed at David Hogg said that the ‘network was interested in adding Mr.Hogg to its trainee program for on the job training as an activist/journalist.’

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) chaired by Tom Perez has sent out a Request for Proposals (RFP) to all 50 states to bid on constructing a suitable monument to the 44th POTUS, Barack Obama. The selected monument must be “shovel ready!” This measure was necessary because the federal government has refused to add Mr. Obama to Mount Rushmore located in South Dakota.
A total of three proposals were received by the DNC from Iowa, Georgia and Alaska. These are states whose Electoral College votes (2016 election) went to Republican Donald Trump to be the 45th POTUS. A summary of the proposals is as follows:
CNN has leaked a statement from a high placed source (not authorized to speak publicly) within the DNC, indicating that a preliminary proposal choice has been made based on requirements, cost and schedule. However, the DNC is going to ask all US registered Democrats to vote on the proposals, via a mail in ballot! (Ed: Beware this may be CNN “Fake News!”)

A Kansas man attempting to insert his penis into the tailpipe of a car had to be subdued with a stun gun after refusing to listen to police.
“We were called to the Midas Muffler Shop on Conway Road concerning a report of a naked male underneath a car,” said Lt. Blake Crosby of the Morgan (Kansas) Police Department. “We observed him while he was attempting to stick his penis into the tailpipe of a late model Chevrolet.”
The suspect did not respond to officer commands and officers used a stun gun to subdue him, the Morgan Daily Gazette reported.
Crosby said the man, who was identified as Hank O’Bera, age 41, was intoxicated to the point of being incoherent.
Police submitted a report to city prosecutors recommending a misdemeanor charge of lewd and lascivious behavior plus a charge of unlawful entry of a motor vehicle.
In recent weeks several Morgan citizens complained of seeing a naked man around parking lots and car dealerships. It took a call by an observant citizen to crack the case now being referred to as the Chevrolet Sex crime.

Space X CEO Elon Musk announced that the Falcon Heavy rocket was launched successfully on February 8, 2018 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This giant vehicle boosted a payload of his cherry-red Tesla sports car, although it could easily boost up to 24 metric tons into an Earth orbit.
This first rocket test also carried a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite, BUTT SNIFFER I into Earth orbit. This satellite will track greenhouse gasses, that supposedly cause climate change. The Infrared to Ultraviolet sensors and spectrum analyzers can detect all the gasses from space, e.g. Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) etc.
China, India and the USA have been identified as the primary sources of greenhouse gasses, but specific emitters have not been localized, yet. Speculation is that Industrial plants, power plants, cows and other domestic animals, trees, coal mines, natural gas fracking, human waste digesters, sewer plants, and decaying vegetation cause these greenhouse gasses.
Specifically, BUTT SNIFFER I looked for sources of Methane gas which is supposedly more potent than carbon Dioxide. As of today, only 10 days of data has been gathered, processed and analyzed. Preliminary findings show that:
It has also been observed from space that: animals (wild and domestic) have developed cloaking devices to ward off predators; the almost 6 billion humans that inhabit Earth add their own Methane signature to the planet; a large blob of hot air is seen dispersing from Washington DC on federal holidays; and when BUTT SNIFFER II is placed in Earth orbit, later this year, the number of Koala Bears in Australia, Penguins in Antarctica and African Elephants, Hippos and Rhinos etc will be counted!
Phone calls from NOAA to PETA Headquarters have not been returned!

Former Democratic President Bill Clinton and failed 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s home is in the small Westchester County town of Chappaqua NY. The town, not far from New York City (NYC), demographically has 1400 residents of which 2.5% are Hispanic and there are zero African Americans.
Thus, it was rather surprising that the Chappaqua NY Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) invited Hillary to speak to their membership and to receive an award. Hillary thought the award was to be like the “Transforming Society” award she received at Harvard University.
The Clintons, including Chelsea, arrived at the NAACP Meeting Hall along with two Secret Service details (eight agents) and four reporters from the New York Times, CNN, The Huffington Post and The Chappaqua Inquirer. The 15 guests were greeted by the seven members of the Chappaqua NAACP Chapter, who are all Republicans.
Hillary was invited to say a few words before the award presentation by Chapter Chairman Max Waters (no relation to the California Democrat), who indicated that increasing Chapter growth would be occurring in 2018.
Prior to speaking to the audience Hillary donned a pointed hat with eyeholes to make a joke out of the previous involvement of the Democratic Party with unsavory activities. She than lauded ex-President Obama’s improvement of African American employment figures, cleverly avoiding Republican President Trump’s quantum leap in employment for the Black Community.
Max Waters than presented Hillary with the Ebony Middle Finger (EMF) award for “Spinning Excuses.” There was a short refreshment gathering by all and then the guests were gone.
Hillary had another Faux Pas to add to her resume!

NYC, NY – (SatireWorld.com):  A New York attorney suspected of laundering dirty money who says he ‘never stepped a foot inside the bouncing Check Republic’ will play schtum before the law courts his lawyer said today.
Michael Cohen, 69, is being probed about taking the piss in a presidential urination scandal involving Russian trollops inside seedy Moscow motels.
Prosecutors have been told the sometime Trump attorney will keep his gob shit about facilitating (sic) payments to voluptuous, large-breasted women on condition a presidential pardon is in the frame.
“Silence is golden,” Cohen’s legal adviser told SatireWorld reporters this morning before adding that “talking is cheap, people follow like Streep – even though there is nowhere to go.”

(satireworld.com) It only took about 50 years of enduring various hard-handed tactics and immense political pressure by the Kennedy clan to keep the secret buried, but today the truth finally appears to be out in public with the grand opening of the Ted Kennedy Memorial Aquarium and the simultaneous opening of the Hollywood-inspired motion picture ‘Chappaquiddick’, an honest re- telling of what really happened when Ted Kennedy drove his Oldsmobile off a bridge late a night and ended a 1972 run for his almost certain Presidency. 
Some claimed the hard partying Ted Kennedy was drunk and lost control of his car while getting a blow job from a campaign worker who later perished when the cowardly Kennedy swam away from the sinking car and neglected to get help for almost 8 or more hours and ended up calling his attorney first before reporting the accident to the proper local authorities.
Others defended the Massachusetts Senator’s actions as simply an ‘unfortunate accident’ on a bridge that was sorely needing repairs and the young Kennedy was unaware. Some say he valiantly and heroically tried to save the young women, Mary Jo Kopeckne but was unable to due to tidal currents and the darkness. 
The truth about Ted Kennedy and his entitled lifestyle will undoubtedly cause a furor among the Kennedy sainthood folks, but the truth about why a married man who was witnessed as being drunk was caught up in a fatal accident and the resulting 50 year old cover-up will enlighten many and finally close a torrid chapter of America’s biggest political cover-up.

The Arizona senator, who’s battling terminal brain cancer, thinks someone suddenly died and made him the leader of the free world.
Proving that he’s determined to be a prickly thorn in President Trump’s side even while waiting to get the sheets changed on his deathbed, McCain once again tried to undermine the President by slamming the tariffs Trump slapped on China and Canada (you know, like the ones they charge on American goods).
Senator McCain tweeted during the G7 Summit: “To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain pro-free trade, pro-globalization and supportive of alliances based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you, even if our president doesn’t.”  
What?  What’s wrong with this guy?
For the record, a seated US senator does not make lone U.S. trade policy, nor does he speak for all Americans.
McCain was reacting to President Trump’s controversial announcement that the U.S. will impose tariffs on some imports from Canada,Mexico and China to make up for the decades-long trade deficit with the countries.
Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Chinese president Xi Jinping responded by imposing retaliatory tariffs. The Mexican President was too busy shipping illegals to our border.
President Trump said it’s time to break the pattern of the United States being treated like “the piggy bank that everybody is robbing.” The U.S. has had lopsided, multi-lateral trade agreements in place for decades. Trump vowed to end that and make fair trade deals that are mutually beneficial.
“People can’t charge us 270% and we charge them nothing. That doesn’t work anymore,” Trump said. “We are like the piggy bank that everybody is robbing. And that ends.” Plus, the US pays an unfair portion of NATO’s defense bills that protects these European dead-beats.”
Many Trump supporters on Twitter reacted by pointing out that President Trump is merely doing what other countries have done to the United States for seven decades.

A pair of conjoined parasitic twins very nearly sold America’s London embassy building to Donald Trump for One Measly Dollar according to Royal Courts of Justice papers filed today.
Depositions seen by SatireWorld reporters describe events of 2008 when the notorious Cuban-born fraudsters used aliases ‘Barack H Obama’ and ‘Eric H Holder’ to claim ownership of the superb Mayfair, Central London site.
“Of course they fucked up big-time,” Professor Einstein of London’s Fraudology Unit commented, “if the Brit cops are to be believed.”
Brokered ‘purely as a patriotic favour to our country’ by the Clinton Foundation’s real estate arm the transaction would have seen Trump the billion dollar property’s new owner.
But the philanthropic gesture collapsed at the first hurdle when land ownership papers were outed as a cheap forgery in a bankruptcy case involving Moscow’s beleaguered GazPogromBank.
“The flipping scam sure soured quickly,” Einstein added in this morning’s press briefing.
The ex-embassy building will now serve London as a massage parlour run by up-and-coming royal wannabe Ms Muggins Markle.

Polar Bear Alaska: 
MacDougal’s Fast Fish Cafe shareholders have rejected a proposal asking the firm to report on its use of plastic straws. This is the latest part of a campaign backed by the self-appointed activist group Environmental Wackos of California (EWOC) pressuring the firm to ban certain food packaging items. The idea won less than 8% of the vote at the company’s annual meeting!
MacDougal’s Fast Fish Cafe management indicated “the requested report is unnecessary, redundant to our current practices and initiatives, and has the potential for a diversion of resources with no corresponding benefit to the company, our customers, and our shareholders.”
EWOC has been pressing MacDougal’s Fast Fish Cafes to end its use plastic straws due to the impact on the environment and wildlife. (Plastic ocean pollution, a third world created problem, is also being blamed on MacDougal’s Fast Food Cafés using too many plastic straws.) An online petition on the issue has attracted nearly 500,000 signatures. However, 100 million Americans eat at MacDougal’s Fast Fish Cafes, meaning that the petition only accounts for 0.5% of Americans.
MacDougal’s Fast Fish Cafe management told shareholders that it already has a goal that by 2020, “all of MacDougal’s Fast Fish Cafe guest packaging (including straws) will come from renewable, recycled or certified sources and not need any further recycling.” The company plans to completely automate its 50,000 stores worldwide using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Computer Control and Robotics to process, cook and serve the fish. The menial jobs will be replaced by high-paying tech jobs for those workers who sign up for the company retraining program.)
Since the boneless fish fillets will be untouched by human hands, they will be served on sanitized germ-free toilet tissue wrapped in sanitized germ-free paper towels. Once the fish and side orders are consumed, the paper products can be recycled through the existing restrooms at any local MacDougal’s Fast Fish Café!

Trey Gowdy just said a few things about the military in response to a stupid question from a CNN reporter about the ban of transgenders. He nails it:
The Military uses prejudice regularly and consistently to deny citizens from joining for being too old or too young, too fat or too skinny, too tall or too short. Citizens are denied for having flat feet, or for missing or additional fingers. Poor eyesight will disqualify you, as well as bad teeth. Malnourished? Drug addiction? Bad back? Criminal history? Low IQ? Anxiety? Phobias? Hearing damage? Six arms? Hear voices in your head? Self-identify as a Unicorn? Need a special access ramp for your wheelchair? Can’t run the required course in the required time? Can’t do the required number of pushups? Not really a “morning person” and refuse to get out of bed before noon? All can be reasons for denial.
The Military has one job. War. Anything else is a distraction and a liability. Did someone just scream “That isn’t Fair”? War is VERY unfair, there are no exceptions made for being special or challenged or socially wonderful. YOU change yourself to meet Military standards.. Not the other way around. I say again: You don’t change the Military… you must change yourself. The Military doesn’t need to accommodate anyone with special issues. The Military needs to Win Wars.
If any of your personal issues are a liability that detract from readiness or lethality… Thank you for applying and good luck in future endeavors. Who’s next in line?

Georgia Farmer Elmer Cadfrey thought Tuesday’s visit by the History Channel’s American Pickers would be a profitable day for him and a chance to unload a lifetime of junk he collected in two of his three large Civil war era barns. Sadly, he spent most of the day down at the Dawson Health Clinic with an ice pack on his nose. 
The show’s two stars, Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz, tried to explain that it really wasn’t their fault that a 1,000 pound Walker’s Snuff sign stored overhead in the dilapidated barn wasn’t properly secured and when slightly moved fell and hit Mr. Cadfrey in his rather large nose.
“After all, it was his sign and it wasn’t worth squat!”
Says Wolfe, “We warned the old dude that we weren’t responsible for any damages and it was clearly spelled out on the History Channel Liability Release that Mr. Cadfrey signed prior to us unloading all that really good shit that we placed randomly in his barn for our later ‘discovery’ while on camera.”
The History Channel’s most successful reality show, American Pickers, takes Wolfe and Fritz around the country as they scour barns, buildings, warehouses, and depots for stores of American Folk Lore and almost forgotten Americana antique items. 
If an item they ‘find’ amidst junk, debris, and worthless items somehow meets their show’s collection criteria, and allows a five minute on-camera discussion about its past, they ‘pay’ the owner for the item.
Mr. Cadfrey claims he had plenty of ‘good shit himself’ and they didn’t need to go salting his barn with counterfeit stuff just for the camera’s sake. He felt real regretful now that they picked his nose instead to highlight an installment with a moment of high drama.

All of the correct answers are from the same person. Each of these quotes are from Ex-President Barack Obama. And now you know why he brought his teleprompter with him everywhere he went as President…even when talking to a 6th grade class. Yet, the liberal media portrayed him as a super genius when he was in college.

A spokesman for the FBI unveiled a plot against a Congresswoman today at a press conference in Los Angeles. The thwarted crime was supposedly formulated by Trump supporters said FBI field agent Henry Winnebago. The charges included to ‘kidnap and extort Administration critic California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, by using a trap-like device located on the grounds of her Los Angeles home’. 
According to the spokesman, the charges specified that the Administration officials planned to keep the out-spoken Waters hidden away until after the 2018 mid-term elections.
Photos of the trapping device were released showing the top-secret apparatus primed and ready to close upon the unsuspecting victim. The clever trapping device was going to be used when the Walters made her daily visit to clean-up debris, used syringes and other homeless litter that accumulates around her 13.4 million dollar mansion located miles from her legitimate district.  
Groundskeeper, Mavis Clem, discovered the booby trapped device during her morning rounds picking up bird droppings from the brick sidewalks. The trap was quickly disarmed and removed by an experienced EOD team brought in from nearby the Marine Base in San Diego. At no time was the Congresswopman in any danger.
White House officials had ‘no comment’ when reporters noticed a White House return address on the box shipping label and asked if the whole matter just might be a pre-election season publicity stunt just to embarrass Administration members.
A tip off to the press that it could be a ‘ mere political set-up’ was a sign stuck in the ground saying ‘free fruit’ with an arrow pointing toward the box which was partially hidden. 
Other reports claim a blonde wig reportedly found a few feet away closely resembled Donald Trump’s hairdo. Scattered around were MAGA hats and leaflets. More troubling evidence were the several broken sticks showing the complexity the perpetrators had in arming the device.
Staffers mentioned the ‘bait’ was later chilled and safely consumed during a Democrat Black Caucus Leaders luncheon held at Waters’ mansion. No one has claimed the lost wig, though several in attendance could have used one.
The agents refused to release additional information, or names, citing ‘need to know’ security. Reporter Martin Shuttlecock, who says he works over at www.satireworld.com, says he figured out the FBI double-talk and that since the FBI’s intelligent service is ‘secret’ no other questions could be answered for the press unless they ‘guessed the right word’. 
Shuttlecock guessed ‘ stupid lying douchebags’ and was promptly ejected from the press corp.

Psycho-surgeons at the Russia Investigation say a succubus – or female sex demon – may have sucked out the President’s brain and laid an egg in the flaccid cavity.  So expect more crazy hatch-lings to soon pop out.
The advice comes amid Trump camp barbs branding FBI Special Counsel Mueller as the Witch-Finder General whose federal ducking stool investigation has totally sunk.
Of course, there’s still the murky business of Trump sorcerer’s apprentice Michael Cohen whose copy of the Golden Showers video is doomed to backfire as a potential get-out-of-jail-free card.

Chernobyl, Ukraine – (SatireWorld.com): A new book about international espionage names Don T Rump as America’s leading Mafia don, describing him ‘a global tentacle-reach close second’ to top KGB matriarch Queen Elizardbirth Vagina.
Just when you thought global realpolitik could not get any verse.
Published by Chernobyl-based Radon Book Corp, former Trump University professor of ethics Dr Swinestein Truncoat’s memoir relates a lifelong career of bugging opponents.
Including every law enforcement agency ‘from the FBI to Mossad’ according to a preview blurb.
“The first sixty-nine chapters reopen a fetid can of worms,” SatireWorld’s book review editor commented, “about the hiring of radioactive hitmen in the UK’s notorious 2006 Plutonium Sandwich caper.”
The London-based attack pickled former UK/Russian double agent Alexander Litvinenko with fatally toxic nuclear crap.
Dr Turncoat believes the finger of suspicion points to ‘an ermine-crazed Russian lunatic’ in Great Britain who ‘totally lost her marbles’ following the Enron collapse.
The book’s remaining chapters deal with the rise of the Rump Organization’s use of lawyers and acc*untants in its class-act ‘legit mainstream’ foray.
Perhaps an eerie echo of the Tom Cruise movie ‘The Firm’.

Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) Infrastructure Plan has been leaked to the Main Stream Media. An astute freelance reporter named Phil broke the story prior to the legislation being introduced into the US House and senate.
A Secret Service agent then grabbed Phil, but seeing his Army Jacket felt sorry for him and disposed of the expired school lunches in a trash can. The agent gave Phil some Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) and took him inside a small Guard Shelter to warm up (it has been 1-degree Fahrenheit for a few days)! The Secret Service agent indicated there was not much action around here as Michelle’s Public-School lunch meals kept vagrants away.
As Phil warmed up he noticed (around midnight) a small balding man carrying a briefcase enter the back door, who he recognizing as Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT). About two hours later the senator emerged, leaving a white bag near the Guard Shelter and headed toward an awaiting automobile. Phil said thanks and good night to the agent and picked up the white bag.
Back at his hotel Phil saw the white bag had “BURN BAG” stenciled on its side. The bag was filled with UNCLASSIFIED, but shredded paper. By dawn Phil had reconstructed the Sanders-Obama Infrastructure Plan, designated The Venezuela Plan (B.S.-1).
The mandated Venezuela Plan was scheduled to be presented to a joint session of Congress ASAP. This full employment plan would be executed in three overlapping phases utilizing US skilled and unskilled workers, illegal immigrants (no need for a border wall) and conscripted labor. The expected completion date being Tuesday November 3, 2020 (just like ObamaCare phony time estimates). Congress would be asked to appropriate $50 trillion (added to the National Debt) to presumably finance the entire project. Plan highlights are as follows:
In 2020 Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) will not be elected the 46th POTUS (along with his vice president candidate Oprah) and the USA will not declare Chapter 11 bankruptcy! Republican President Trump will be reelected. The reason, all Congressional Democrats aren’t stupid enough to believe Senator Sander’s goofy fairy tale plan, that is now residing in a Congressional Committee file drawer or the bottom of a birdcage!

While addressing reporters on Thursday, Rep/. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) lost her breath during several short sentences, suffered more brain freezes and could be seen staring blankly at reporters, while also frequently repeating words.
Pelosi got tongue-tied again as she welcomed Conor Lamb to the House hedging his confirmation as a special election winner before an official validated the winner in a tightly contested race. She flubbed his name referring to him as Sarah Connor, a character from the Terminator movie. She was forced to repeat it several times. At the same time, she appeared to run out of breath while speaking the short sentence, having to take a deep breath to finish.
While again disparaging the tax cut passed last year, she forgot words as she said “83 of the benefits to the top 1%.”
Pelosi again ran out of breath a short time later, having to pause her statement to suck wind.
She would repeat words, and it didn’t seem like it was for effect.
“Seven in 10 will not sh— hire new employees. Seven in 10 will not hire new employees,” she repeated.
After suffering yet another brain freeze, she complimented herself for a speech she gave yesterday to students who refused to go to school.
“My best line they liked,” she patted herself on the back, then minutes later she completely botched an attack on her GOP colleagues.
After suffering three more brain freezes and groping for words, Pelosi again paused to take a deep breath and told reporters that Democrats are committed to immigration reform and hoped that Canada would allow more Democrats to immigrate.
She nearly broke out into giggles as she recalled asking a priest for a fork so she could eat dessert at a St. Patrick’s Day event last year.
Alex Montage, an engineer from M.I.T suggested using Pelosi’s brain as a ‘refrigeration source’ to preserve embryos when power fails in some US fertilization clinics. Others called for recycling Pelosi as a means of preserving fresh fish at sea.

The Miss America Organization announced today an end to the swimsuit portion of its competition and the practice of judging contestants specifically on their outward appearance.
Marion Snodgrass, who was crowned Miss America in 1939, made the announcement of the Labor Day event’s new direction on Tuesday’s broadcast of Good Morning America, SatireWorld reported.
Branding the pageant “Miss America 2.0,” Snodgrass said, “We’re not going to judge girls on their appearance because we are interested in what they have to say versus what they look like.”
Snodgrass hinted that contestant’s on site SAT score results and a ‘spelling bee’ portion of the event will take the place of the swim suit and evening gown competition.
Snodgrass, the latest head of the pageant’s board of directors, added that many contestants expressed criticism of the swimsuit and evening gown portion of the pageant in this day of a heightened awareness of sexual harassment. “We can’t have nice boobs and legs getting the way of listening about ideas concerning world peace.”
Snodgrass, who filed a sexual harassment suit against past Miss America President 450lb James ‘Jumbo’ Harrington precipitating his departure from the event, added that some contestants told pageant officials, “We don’t want to be out there in high heels and swimsuits,” in this era of #MeToo awareness.
The changes will refocus the pageant on talents, Snodgrass said. “It’s what comes out of their mouths that we care about,” she added.
The elimination of the swimsuit segment ends an over 100-year tradition. Indeed, the pageant was created in 1921 out of an annual Labor Day beauty contest started in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the early 1900s. A main feature of the original beauty contest, the “Inter-City Beauties,” was the public swimsuit contest held on the Garden Pier. The winners originally vied for the “Golden Mermaid” trophy.

Porn star Stormy Daniels is working with a LAPD forensic sketch artist to help identify the man she claims threatened her with ‘certain incineration’ to stay silent about an alleged tryst she had with President Trump over 14 years ago.
Michael Avenatti, Daniels’ lawyer, tweeted Sunday a photo of his client sitting next to “foremost forensic artist,” Lois Gibson, as she looks through a book with images of faces.
Gibson claims her sketches has helped identify over 7,000,000 criminals, according to her website.
Avenatti’s photo tease comes a day after he said a “major announcement” was coming soon regarding the “efforts to identify the thug who threatened Ms. Clifford in Las Vegas in 2011 to “leave Trump alone” while making reference to her little girl.”
“You can run but you can’t hide,” the lawyer warned.
Daniels told CBS’ “60 Minutes” that 10 years after she gave a magazine an interview about the supposed tryst, a man threatened her with a can of gasoline as she was heading to the gym in Las Vegas.
“A guy walked up on me and said to me, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,’” she said. “And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if her mom got even more hotter.’”
Daniels said she never saw the man carrying the gas can again, but would immediately recognize him if they ever crossed paths again and believes the artist sketch would help authorities.

The United States Postal Service announced today that the long overdue commemorative stamp issue celebrating the two-term presidency of Barack Obama are now on sale at most USPS locations. 
The Postal Service admits somewhat sheepishly that sales are somewhat disappointing and many blame the design itself in which users must first lick the back first prior to affixing to the mail piece. Supporters of the ex-President say it was a racist feature created by the current Administration allowing users to ‘spit’ at the memory of America’s first black leader.
USPS officials say they’ve adjusted the second issue that commemorates the Affordable Healthcare Act, aka Obamacare, by using slow drying adhesive where patrons can re-use the stamp in case they change their minds about mailing a letter.
The USPS spokesperson says all stamp issues are both in handy rolls or the sheet editions most preferred by collectors. First Edition printings are available online.

Punxsutawney Phil is a fabled groundhog living in Punxsutawney PA. On February 2 (USA Groundhog Day) each year, the town of Punxsutawney celebrates this legendary groundhog with a festive atmosphere of music, food and drink. During the traditional ceremony, which begins before the winter sunrise, Phil emerges from his temporary home on Gobbler’s Knob, located about two miles from town.
According to tradition, if Phil sees his shadow and returns to his hole, he has predicted six more weeks of winter-like weather. If Phil does not see his shadow, he has predicted an “early spring!” As of 2017, Phil has made 130 predictions and has been proven correct 39% of the time.
However, this year Phil sent word to the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle (PGCHIC) that he will be retiring at midnight January 31, 2018. Phil communicates in Groundhogese to the President of the PGCHIC (people with the top hats at the ceremony).
According to legend there is only one Phil and all other groundhogs are impostors. To continue the local tradition a search was made, and no willing substitute Groundhog was found. Hillary Clinton’s name was suggested! “What Happen” is that Hillary’s expensive $500,000 speaking engagements have dried up and she is currently available for Grammy Award cameo appearances, weddings, wakes, Christenings, First Communions and Bar Mitzvahs (no circumcisions)!
There were no Groundhog costumes available in town or deliveries from Amazon.com in time, but a Bunny pantsuit was found. After several failed attempts to stuff Hillary into Phil’s burrow, there was a brief panic!
Bill Murray an honorary member of the PGCHIC, visiting this year’s ceremony on the 25th anniversary of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Groundhog Day motion picture spoke to Phil in Groundhogese! Phil agreed to stay on for one more year and to negotiate for better working conditions!
Unfortunately, no one will ever know if Hillary dressed in a Bunny pantsuit and coming out of a hole in the ground would have seen her shadow?

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given conditional approval to a newly developed medication called “SHUTHOLE” to help politicians cure their Foot in Mouth Disease, Diarrhea of the Mouth, Fake News Generation and Habitual Lying. The FDA also has called for follow up field testing using control groups of Democratic politicians, as one of the side effects of the drug is acute constipation.
Three professors at the University of Maryland (UMD), one teaching Chemical Engineering, the second teaching Pharmacology, and the third teaching Political Science, spent their free time in the college’s chemistry laboratories developing “SHUTHOLE!” The professors observed the Democratic Obama administration (2009-2017), and dysfunctional Democratic Congressional leadership, deciding a curative pill was sorely needed.
Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration key personnel and Democratic Congressional leader’s behaviors were then computer modelled to develop “SHUTHOLE” (Footnote 1). Testing was performed on laboratory rats and graduate students. Several boxes of “SHUTHOLE” were also provided as a courtesy to the cited Democratic politicians. No feedback was received from their offices.
Cyanoacrylate (Super Glue) has been removed from the “SHUTHOLE” formula, alleviating the constipation problems, verified by additional laboratory rats and graduate student testing.
The Republican Trump administration has asked the FDA to formally initiate “SHUTHOLE” testing of all the previously cited Democratic politicians plus additional Democratic politicians involved in shutting down the Federal Government (Footnote 2). Dependent on the resolution of “Schumer’s Shutdown” and drug test results, “SHUTHOLE” will be prescribed for all Democratic members of the US House and Senate!

Mr. Schultz has indicated he is concerned with the country’s direction, specifically with respect to Senator Bernie Sanders Socialist agenda of Medicare for all, free college for all, a $15 per hour federal minimum wage and the US government providing a job for everyone!
Juan Valdez, a close political advisor to Mr. Schultz was not pleased that the prospective candidate has no prior name recognition, with only two years till the 2020 Presidential Election. Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump did! Mrs. Olsen, Shultz’s Female Matters Advisor agreed. For example, the voters might think the candidate was corrupt Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), or Sgt. Hans Schultz of Hogan’s Heroes or even Charles Schultz the late cartoonist of Peanuts.
Lately the Walt Disney Company has been moving left to support many Democratic Party political and social issues. Mr. Schultz’s political advisors approached the Walt Disney Studios executives (Burbank CA) on behalf of teaming up with Mickey Mouse to head the ticket.

North Korean leader Kim Song-Un pulled no punches Saturday as a committee representing him and other DPRK leaders demanded parity with other Winter Olympic athletes and suggested the North have a winter rocket launching category so 50,000 DRPK soldiers can compete.
South Korean officials claim that housing 50,000 fully armed soldiers is allowing an invasion under the guise of Olympic Competition and in addition would exhaust all competitor’s housing facilities. North Korea countered by adding that its soldiers ‘have no problem’ buddying-up other teams especially with girls from Japan and Iran.
Up until several weeks ago the DPRK boycotted any participation in the South Korean hosted Winter Olympics, but due to severe food rationing in the North, military leaders decided participating would be an innovative way of feeding thousands of troops after months of eating saw dust laden bread products and a protein sustenance consisting mainly of dried fish, rodents, and insects scavenged from rotting corn husks.

Policy changes in national parks primitive area usage rested upon a pending decision by both the EPA and Interior Department over pending access to natural trail systems for handicapped and other physical ability limited users.
Last week, the Interior Department heard heated debate and presentations at a congressional hearing touting economic benefits, as well as, environmental impacts that could play a part in the decision. A successful outcome will allow up to 2.7 million extra visitors a year using the 1500 mile long Appalachian Trail system that snakes thru rural parts of Georgia and other states all the way up to Maine. 
Extra trail traffic would include bikes, skateboards, motorcycles, roller skates, wheelchairs, ATVs, plus vendors and staffers. The plan would include allowing  motorized vehicles as long as any battery or gasoline fueled vehicles are under 95 HP and have spark proof mufflers and DOT approved driving lights.
Wilderness associations and primitive hiker groups have protested the proposal for almost 2 years ever since the Supreme Court ruled that People For Free Use of US Facilities (who brought the suit) specifically stated in their complaint that wheel chair and ambulatory citizens were being denied ‘free and reasonable access’ to natural outdoor facilities paid and cared for by all citizen taxpayers.
The Interior Department and EPA plan is expected to allow construction of a six-foot wide paved pathway that will follow alongside the existing trail. The original Appalachian Trail has been in place for over 85 years. 
Expected completion is spring 2027.

In scenes reminiscent of the now-infamous April 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege (starring Meryl Streep as Ayatollah Khomenei) the tense stand-off began Friday morning when a suspicious looking quadcopter crashed the legation’s security cameras.
“Probably a drone from Julian Assange’s pot delivery service,” a Barking, Isle of Dogs-based Reuterus News Agency stringer told SatireWorld reporters, “blown off-course from its Ecuadorean Embassy spider hole destination.
“Iranians inside are shitting bricks.”
The drone is thought to have originated from the Jamaican Wing of South London’s notorious Wormwood Scrubs Prison where the bespoke weed delivery service is based catering to London’s five million cannabis users ‘including fugitives from Justice like Julian Assange’.
The news comes amid reports that a high-ranking Second Attaché had been caught earlier trying to obtain political asylum on grounds of diminished responsibility in an unrelated ongoing acrimonious matrimonial case.
Responding to these startling allegations a spokesperson for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said, “Bollox to this story, there are NO bloody Iranians inside the Ecuadorean Embassy building.”

It started out as a simple picnic in Twin Falls Park when Anthony ‘Rocco’ Pietro felt different than when he first arrived at the picnic area. That’s what lawyers are saying in a recent lawsuit filed against Krafty Foods where they claim Krafty’s Zesty Italian Salad Dressing made their client into an instant homosexual.
Pietro, age 26, claims beforehand he did all kinds of manly things like playing football, going hunting with his friends from high school, doing roofing work, and dating girls with big tits. “Now, all I do is girly things like shape my eyebrows, pluck hair from my chest, and watch HGTV on television all the time. I’m a mess!”
Pietro’s lawyers agree and are asking $100 million dollars in damages from the food giant. “Our client suffered greatly because of this. All he thinks about are men in tight shorts and how he’ll tell his Mom that the salad dressing she packed in his lunch basket caused him to cross over to the dark side.”
Others have come forward saying they had similar results after consuming Krafty salad products. Several are also within the same age group and hadn’t had homosexual tendencies prior to eating the Krafty product.
Fitness guru Richard Simmons, who says he’s on the late side of twenty, says the first time he had some Zesty Italian was at an Italian restaurant where he claims he woke up cuddled in server Salvatore Gucchi’s lap while both were naked!
Another popular personality who supports Pietro’s claim is Hairdresser-to-the-Stars, David Torso who says a Zesty Italian ‘popped his cherry’ back in 1978.
Biker ‘Rumble’ Reilly says a weird thing happened to him last year when he only accidentally spilled a bottle of Zesty Italian down ‘Mad Dog’ Henry’s back at a biker BBQ. “Once I tried wiping the stuff off Mad Dog’s back he gets all moonie-eyed and starts grabbing my crotch! Good thing I had my leathers on and he couldn’t feel my junk!”

Gore’s Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth did not warn of record cold and increasing snowfalls as a consequence of man-made global warming. And as recently as 2009, Gore was hyping the lack of snow as evidence for man-made global warming. Maybe Al Gore doesn’t know a thing about climate change after all and his Academy Award was just a consolation prize from liberal supporters for getting his liberal butt kicked in the 2000 Presidential election.
Faced with ‘Bomb Cyclones,’ freezing weather in Florida, and temperatures of minus 100 set to hit in New Hampshire the Global Warming crowd are now at a loss of words as  their Chevy Volts struggle to run in frigid battery-sucking temperatures… But as the snow piled up, the climate changer’s claims were simply adjusted and now extreme cold and snow were added to the list of things caused by ‘global warming.’
Predictions of less snow and less severe winters were hammered into the public by global warming scientists for years. But once that prediction failed to come true, the opposite of what they predicted instead became… “well, this extreme cold weather is what they expected all along.” 
If ‘climate change’ is causing record cold and snow, then it would stand to reason that Gore is suggesting that if the U.S. had ratified the UN’s Kyoto Protocol treaty on “global warming” back in the 1990’s — the winter of 2018 would have been warmer?
Now it seems scientists are not buying the claims of Gore and others linking the record cold and snow to “global warming.”

Phoenix, AZ – (SatireWorld.com)
An Arizona legislator raised eyebrows this week with a suggestion that the state should name a holiday just for US Caucasian males. State Rep. Cecil Ash’s remarks began in jest while he was speaking on the Arizona House floor Monday, but when asked to clarify them later, Ash doubled down and said he thought such a holiday was not only a good idea, but a great idea that will be sure to catch on nationally.
It started when state Rep. Richard Miranda, a Democrat, said Arizona should have a day to celebrate Latino Americans Males, Phoenix CBS affiliate KPHO-TV reported. According to the station, Miranda’s suggestion touched off a tense debate, and that’s when Ash stepped in to try to relieve the tension with a moment of levity.
Dubbed The Prime Steak and Blowjob Day, Ash felt white American males were finally due this honor for all the abuse and hard work they’ve put in year after year.
“I’m supportive of this proposition…I just want them to assure me that when we do become in the minority you’ll have a day set aside for us,” Ash, a Republican, said. Ash reportedly has close ties to the Arizona Ranchers Association and owns a beef ranch in Temple.
His words achieved their desired effect and got a few laughs. But after his comments got out, he told KPHO he stood by them.
“I think that if and when the Caucasian population becomes a minority, they may want to celebrate the accomplishments and the contributions of the Caucasian population the same way others celebrate, but ours will be the most fun. Besides us white guys are sick of BBQs, ties, and wallet…We need something special” Ash said.
He told the station he thinks the state should acknowledge the accomplishments of great people, regardless of their ethnicity.
KPHO spoke with a few Arizonans to get their thoughts about Ash’s proposal: Reaction was mixed, with one person calling it a “crazy idea” but another saying it was a “good idea — Like they have Cinco de Mayo for Mexicans. We need something for whites and there’s nothing like a great Arizona raised beefsteak followed by a wonderful blowjob by a pretty lady afterwards.”
Mrs. Ash was not available for comment.

 Republican President Donald Trump had an interesting week in the Nation’s Capital including; consideration of new import tariffs, gun control proposals, DACA legislation proposals, Russian President Putin’s new nuclear missile, Maxine Waters calling President Trump a racist and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un inviting President Trump to come to the table and talk. The latter three items appear quite significant.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was overheard asking President Trump if Russian Federation President Putin and Representative Waters should be mentioned during next week’s press briefing as helping getting Kim Jong Un to the table? Sarah replied, don’t push it as the North Koreans might charge the USA with “Cruel and Unusual Punishment!”

The Hillary Clinton 2016 election loss blame game took a new turn this past week as yet another excuse was hurled out onto the airwaves. First, we had insults directed toward rural voters. Then it was the unproven Russian collusion….Throw in the Republican vast right-wing conspiracy….Or some unfriendly media coverage….Then the FBI! Now it’s turned more appealing now that mentioning personal health issues just might garner more sympathy.
In a long-winded speech in Mumbai, India, ex-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke of her 34 year long fight against a Simian Yeast Infection she contacted in Africa where she had vacationed with several friends in 1984. She claimed an eruption of symptoms caused her to stumble on multiple occasions and on at least one instance, to feint in front of cameras.
Dr. Clifford Hanes MD, a noted expert on vaginal illnesses and author of two famous books on common yeast infections, said it was possible Clinton had associated health issues like falling, feinting, and having troupes of professional bakers following her around causing her some anxiety in public settings.

Washington, DC  –
Policy changes in national parks primitive area usage rested upon a pending decision by both the EPA and Interior Department over pending access to natural trail systems for handicapped and other physical ability limited users.
Last week, the Interior Department heard heated debate and presentations at a congressional hearing touting economic benefits, as well as, environmental impacts that could play a part in the decision. A successful outcome will allow up to 2.7 million extra visitors a year using the 1500 mile long Appalachian Trail system that snakes thru rural parts of Georgia and other states all the way up to Maine. 
Extra trail traffic would include bikes, skateboards, motorcycles, roller skates, wheelchairs, ATVs, plus vendors and staffers. The plan would include allowing  motorized vehicles as long as any battery or gasoline fueled vehicles are under 95 HP and have spark proof mufflers and DOT approved driving lights.
Wilderness associations and primitive hiker groups have protested the proposal for almost 2 years ever since the Supreme Court ruled that People For Free Use of US Facilities (who brought the suit) specifically stated in their complaint that wheel chair and ambulatory citizens were being denied ‘free and reasonable access’ to natural outdoor facilities paid and cared for by all citizen taxpayers.
The Interior Department and EPA plan is expected to allow construction of a six-foot wide paved pathway that will follow alongside the existing trail. The original Appalachian Trail has been in place for over 85 years. 
Expected completion is spring 2027.

After a much heralded meeting about prison reform Donald Trump had off hand remarks about Kim Kardashian’s large ass…Yes, you heard it here first!
Twice in the last six months aides had to rush in to save an exploding clothing seam that threatened to unravel and expose casual viewers to more ‘information then they required’ while Kim Kardashian pranced around in public like she was someone who was really important.
Folks down at the Jimmy Dean sausage company have noticed and have introduced a pork sausage shaped like Kim Kardashian and her like endowed sisters called the ‘Media Hoglets.’  Spokesman Abe Hurst says, “we noticed her skin tight dresses and short skirts so we decided to make a product with 87% fat so others could share that Kardashian-fat-ass.” 
It was only a few months ago when the media skewered singer Jessica Simpson over her post baby weight gain, and let’s not forget the personal torment Britany Spears suffered at the hands of pundits over her weight gain too. But with Mudshark Kardashian, not a negative word, but just more and more mindless coverage of a talentless media whore.
So, how does Kim Kardashian like being called a fat ass? Well, her publicist Karen Tremont says she’ll pursue a new reality show called, ‘Kim Kardashian’s Derrière Smothers LA’ hoping to beat competitors who will no doubt copy-cat the fat ass/reality show concept.

London – (SatireWorld.com) – Police on the trail of £30 millionsworth of jewelry from the Hatton Garden heist have issued artist’s impressions of several engagement sparklers suspected of being fenced into eager royal hands.
2015’s notorious City theft saw half a dozen robbers tunnel their way into an underground safe deposit box strongroom before looting its contents over an extended holiday weekend.
The six – all septuagenarians with previous in armed robbery – were eventually caught and sentenced to decades in the slammer for what His Honor the Judge described as a bloody audacious act.
“Some of the missing loot looks like it’s now back in the spotlight,” a Serious &amp; Organised Crime source told SatireWorld reporters amid a rash of royal engagement headlines featuring celebrity Z-Listers.
And other misguided snouts-in-the-trough trash.
A spokesperson for Queen Elizardbirth at Buckingham Palace said ‘F**k orf you bastards’ when asked for a comment on this farce breaking story.

Washington DC – (SatireWorld.com):  White House advisers are finessing some unprecedented diversionary moves to steady the President’s hand as ex-FBI chief James Comey’s eagerly awaited memoir readies to hit the shops.
Provisionally entitled ‘A Not-For-Hire Loyalty’ next week’s publication of the 1,000-page tome sees Don T Rump’s nerves teetering off the Novichok richter scale according to reliable (sic) DC reports.
“POTUS fired Comey when things got uncomfortable in the presidential sack,” a DC deep throat told SatireWorld reporters amid a ‘Rump-got-caught-in-bed-with-Russian-spy-Anna-Kushchenko-Chapman’ rumor swirl.
An ensuing progeny farrowed nine months later is said to have his mother’s hooks.  Uh, looks.
Commenting on this farce-breaking development a security language specialist  suggested Rump ‘may be bumming it’ to purposefully look like shit in a pubic setting by dumping on Syria.

Washington DC: (satireworld.com) House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) tweeted to her constituents that she now wholeheartedly supports the NRA! ‘After a lot of soul searching and discussions with my US House leadership team of 1st “Horse Holder” Representative Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and 2nd “Horse Holder” Representative James Clyburn (D-SC) we have concluded it is the right thing to do.’
Reaction from the far-left progressive wing of the Democratic Party was swift and brutal, as indicated by the following Tweets.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and her US House Leadership Team hastily called a press conference to clear the air! However, unsurprisingly Pelosi did all the talking about the NRA. She said it’s about time the US House of Representatives reexamined the 85-year old NRA legislation, passed when I was very young!
 
In 1935, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously declared that the NRA law was unconstitutional, ruling that it infringed the separation of powers under the United States Constitution. The NRA quickly stopped operation. (Wikipedia)

New Brunswick, NJ – (satireworld.com)
In the past, ex-Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been known to make huge sums in speaking fees, but Thursday’s reported payment for another excuse filled speech of ‘why I lost’ barely covered her security and travel costs. Will she complain now about how she was short-changed? Perhaps her once golden crown has simply turned into another brass plating job.
Clinton was paid $25,000 to speak at Rutgers University about being targeted as a woman in politics, the upcoming elections and the Trump administration, among other topics, NJ.com reported.
But the money she made seemed to be considerably less than some other high-profile guests who’ve spoken at the New Jersey school.
And while Clinton’s fee for Thursday’s speech was nothing to scoff at, it was considerably smaller than what she reportedly received for appearances in past years.

Officials at the US Depository, better known as Fort Knox, have found the need for adding more secure storage room at the 80 year old facility built to store the nation’s gold during the Roosevelt era when private gold ownership was outlawed. Located in rural Kentucky the official US Gold Depository is home to the United State’s gold reserves reported to be valued at $750 billion dollars.
Reports on the internet, television, and in the press confirm vast amounts of almost pure gold being mined in the sleepy Panhandle town of Blountstown, Florida. According to the local paper, the Tallahassee Democrat, most discoveries are being made by ordinary citizens. The Tallahassee Democrat also reported that local banks have reached the point where there is no available vault room left in the four-county area to safely store gold bullion at the rate local miners are smelting the gold nuggets into 100% gold ingots.
Stuart Rodgers, the superintendent of the Gold Depository and official spokesman, claims they’ll be adding an additional 35,000 square feet of storage but it will be hardly visible from ground level. “We will be digging pretty deep to safe-guard all that shiny new gold we’ll be receiving soon,” said Rodgers who held up an artist’s drawing showing gold rolling off specially armored fleet of trucks.
In recent months the super large gold strike in rural Blountstown Florida has drawn international attention simply because it’s larger than the past gold rushes of the Yukon and California rolled into one. Some experts are claiming it could dwarf all historical gold production from South African mines.
According to a mining and minerals expert from Georgia Tech, ‘the gold find will go down in history simply because it’s easily found surface gold and not much actual mining is required. In fact, several new millionaires were made just from scraping a few inches of soil away from the ground.’ 
Last Tuesday US media outlets reported that two eleven year old girls reportedly playing in a school sandbox found almost $15,000 worth of gold dust clinging to their socks.
Blountstown mayor Marshall Biggers said on TV’s First Edition that remarkable things have been happening to ordinary people including his son-in-law Lester Jones who’s a backhoe operator for the city’s Board of Public Works.
“Now, I’ll  be the first to admit that Lester ain’t all that bright an all, but last week Lester was cleaning out a drainage ditch down on Robert E Lee Circle when his backhoe pulled up a nice-sized gold nugget buried just about a foot down. Merle over at the Honest Pawn valued that rock at around $8,500 dollars, Not bad and the city gonna get half.”

The United States Chicken Bureau said today that President Rump would be pushing hard during his upcoming state visit to sell Brits millions of fluoridated American chickens in a landmark trade deal.
Wholesome with sturdy beaks and native plumage the six week old chicks come ready-treated to high US food hygiene standards – and at least sixty-five cents a pound cheaper than indigenous British birds.
“Brits consume more than one billion fowl anally – uh, annually!” a Chicken Bureau spokesperson explained at a campaign launch to win over skeptical UK consumers.
“A wee bit of chlorine just peps up the taste.”

Various transportation policing agencies use CCTV and “Facial Recognition SW” technology to monitor people’s faces at New York City (NYC) airports, railroad/commuter terminals and bus stations. The cameras supporting a facial recognition capability are located near ticket counters, boarding and luggage pick up areas, and schedule boards at transportation centers.
NYPD has reported that criminals e.g. wanted felons, terrorists and illegal immigrants, have been apprehended using this smart camera technology. However, some criminals have resorted to a rash of “mooning” the CCTV cameras!
Countermeasures have been instituted to catch this minority of “smart asses” by using “Butt Recognition SW” and stored data bases. This new technology’s databases yield twice as much data; tattoos (MOTHER, OBAMA, BLM, KKK), bullet holes, knife wound scars, moles and embedded splinters for matching. A potential problem area has been identified with tinted or colored butts (the tinted butt problem is currently being worked at UC Berkeley).
Baltimore MD, Los Angeles CA, Detroit MI and Chicago IL transportation agencies are greatly interested in this new “Butt Recognition SW” surveillance technology and to share NYC’s databases. Finger printing convicted felons could be augmented by “Butt Printing” them via a computer connected XEROX Machine directly interfaced to a database!
Chicago O’Hare International Airport is considering developing a test program that matches an individual’s face (or butt) to their driver’s license photo and possibly to a “Butt Print.” The Chicago City Council has petitioned the Office of the Illinois Secretary of State to place “Butt Prints” on the reverse side of everyone’s state driver’s license.
The ACLU called “Butt Recognition SW” a cheeky way to catch criminals!

Hypocrites unite! Join the Democratic Party and be with friends like Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Schumer the Tumor, or Nancy Pelosi! 
Crumbs you say? 
I can imagine a large commercial winery like the Pelosi family owns and has a net worth of around $40 million can call a $1,000 check ‘crumbs’ if they want. It’s especially ironic coming from a veteran politician representing a state where one in five is below the poverty level. It’s also hypocritical that Nancy the Crumb also is set to receive an additional benefit of special tax cuts totaling $180,000 for her winery operation. Why, I bet she voted for that one!
Bonuses. Tax cuts. Deregulation that saves taxpayers money protects and US jobs. If you’re against these why you must be a true blue Democrat! After all, not one Democrat voted for the tax cut in either the House or Senate. Not one!
Yet, and this confuses me and probably others as well, why haven’t these loyal party-loyal Democrats refused to accept their share of tax cut benefits? You know, send a check back to the US Treasury Department as their way of saying ‘no thanks…none for me!’
How many bonus recipients who work for many of the largest US employers that are in line for a bonus ranging from one-thousand up to three-thousand have publicly emerged from the Democrat closet of fear and loathing and said out loud…’Keep it! I’m a real Democrat!’
The hypocrisy goes on. The anti-Trump press blathers onward with just slight distortions that border on slander and are feinted as truth. The rank and file Democrats seem comfortable nested in a reign of disgusting and shameful behavior towards anything Republican. Probably the only good thing to come of this is that the national spotlight held by that all faithful Silent Majority is squarely aimed at the dark heart of Democratic politics and now brightly illuminating the hypocrisy for all to see.
